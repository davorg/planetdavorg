              <h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2022/01/2021-in-gigs.html">2021 in Gigs</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>A little later than usual, here&#8217;s my review of the gigs I saw last year.</p>
<p>In 2020, I saw four gigs. In 2021, I almost doubled that to seven. Obviously, we spent a lot of the year with most music venues closed, so those few gigs I saw were all in the second half of the year. Usually, I&#8217;d list my top ten gigs. This year (as last year) I&#8217;ll be listing them all. So here they are in chronological order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39755096-mike-oldfield-at-royal-festival-hall-southbank-centre">Tubular Bells at the Royal Festival Hall</a></strong><br />
This was a strange show for several reasons. Firstly, it was advertised as commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of <em>Tubular Bells</em>. But the album was released in 1973, so it was two years early (apparently it was the fiftieth anniversary of when Mike Oldfield started writing the piece). Secondly, Mike Oldfield wasn&#8217;t performing &#8211; but you needed to examine the publicity very carefully to work that out. And thirdly, there was a troupe of acrobats that were pointlessly leaping around the stage while the musicians played. All in all, I thought this was slightly disappointing.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/38968289-heaven-17-at-roundhouse">Heaven 17 at the Roundhouse</a></strong><br />
Many of these shows were postponed from 2020. This was originally intended to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Human League album, <em>Travelogue</em>, but it ended but being the forty-first anniversary. But none of that mattered. This was Heaven 17 playing all of the first two Human League albums and it was absolutely wonderful. Apparently, they had invited Phil Oakey to take part, but he wasn&#8217;t interested. That&#8217;s Heaven 17 in the photo above.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39828850-lump-at-scala">LUMP at the Scala</a></strong><br />
LUMP is Laura Marling playing with Tunng&#8217;s Mike Lindsay. I kinda assumed that their first album was going to be a one-off, but they produced a second album in 2020. This was the first gig I&#8217;d been to in a cramped venue like the Scala for a couple of years and it all got a bit too much for me. I really didn&#8217;t enjoy the atmosphere and left during the third or fourth song. I still love the album though and I hope to build up my tolerance for gig crowds over the coming months.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39773071-staves-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire">The Staves at Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Empire</a></strong><br />
Actually, this was only two-thirds of the Staves. One of the sisters has has a baby recently and has decided to sit out tours for a couple of years. But the two remaining sisters still put on a great show.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39786793-laura-marling-at-roundhouse">Laura Marling at the Roundhouse</a></strong><br />
Given how few gigs I saw last year, it&#8217;s surprising how repetitive they were. Here&#8217;s Laura Marling again (and the Roundhouse again!) Although she has yet to match the heights of the <em>Short Movie</em> tour, Laura Marling is always worth seeing and this show was no exception.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39662320-heaven-17-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire">Heaven 17 at the Shepherd&#8217;s Bush</a></strong><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39662320-heaven-17-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire"> Empire</a></strong><br />
More repetition. I think the two Heaven 17 gigs were originally supposed to be several months apart, but the vagaries of the Covid scheduling changes led to them being just two months apart. This one celebrated the fortieth (actually forty-first) anniversary of Heaven 17 starting and was a glorious journey through their back catalogue. Oh, and the support was Pete Wylie, so I can finally say I&#8217;ve seen all three members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucial_Three">Crucial Three</a> live.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39709208-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-at-eventim-apollo">Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark at Hammersmith Apollo</a></strong><br />
OMD are just one of those bands that I see live whenever I can. I&#8217;ve now been seeing them for over forty years (since they supported Gary Numan in 1980). They have such a massive back catalogue that they can just play hit after hit for two hours. But this show was a bit different as they started by playing all of their 1981 album, <em>Architecture and Morality</em>. They were as good as I&#8217;ve ever seen them.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that was 2021. What will happen in 2022? Well, I have tickets for a dozen or shows but who knows how many of them I&#8217;ll actually see? I&#8217;ve already had emails postponing the Wolf Alice and Peter Hook shows I was going to see this month. I guess I&#8217;ll just have to wait and see how the rest of the year pans out.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>At about this time of the year, I usually write an overview of the gigs I&#8217;ve seen in the year. The post always starts with me saying how many gigs I&#8217;ve seen during the year. This is the tenth year I&#8217;ve been writing these posts and in that time I&#8217;ve seen between 35 (<a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2018/12/2018-in-gigs.html">2018</a>) and 60 (<a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2013/12/2013-gigs.html">2013</a>) gigs in a year.</p>
<p>This year, I&#8217;ve seen four gigs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to add in a strange gig-cum-lecture that I saw a couple of weeks ago in order to list the top five gigs I saw this year. Here they are in chronological order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39231390-john-grant-at-roundhouse">John Grant at the Roundhouse</a></strong><br />
This is the second time I&#8217;ve seen John Grant live. The first time (at the Hammersmith Apollo a few years ago) he had a full band with him, but this time it was just him and a pianist. It was a great start to my gig-going year. I also had a ticket to see him at Alexandra Palace later in the year, but that show has already been postponed twice.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39134185-hate-moss-at-old-blue-last">Hate Moss at the Old Blue Last</a></strong><br />
I don&#8217;t go to the Old Blue Last enough. It&#8217;s a tiny room above a pub in Shoreditch and every time I go there I have a really good time. This time I was drawn there because one of the support acts (<a href="https://m-orchestra.com/">M-orchestra</a>) is an old colleague from the BBC who had just started gigging again after a long hiatus. He was great (check out his streams on Facebook) and the fact that the other two acts on the bill were also very good was a bonus.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/38135579-ladytron-at-heaven">Ladytron at Heaven</a></strong><br />
Another show I went to because of the support act. I try to see <a href="https://stealingsheep.net/">Stealing Sheep</a> whenever I can so I bought a ticket for this just knowing they were on the bill. If you know anything about my musical taste then you&#8217;ll probably be surprised that I had never listened to Ladytron before buying the ticket. I investigated them before the gig and found an amazing band who I&#8217;ve been listening to a lot ever since. That&#8217;s Ladytron in the photo at the top of the page.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39140946-tove-lo-at-o2-forum-kentish-town">Tove Lo at the Forum</a></strong><br />
I saw Tove Lo at <a href="https://mightyhoopla.com/">Mighty Hoopla</a> in Brockwell Park in 2019. I&#8217;m not much of a festival fan but I enjoyed her and added her to my list of people to see indoors as soon as possible. This was that show and it was pretty enjoyable stuff, but subsequent events mean it has taken on rather more importance than it might otherwise have enjoyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I saw Tove Lo on March 12. Eleven days later, Boris Johnson put us in lockdown and my inbox turned into a sea of cancellations and postponements. I had a full schedule of upcoming gigs booked, but they&#8217;ve all been either cancelled or postponed until next year (or, in a couple of cases, 2022). I watched a couple of streamed gigs, but it&#8217;s really not the same at all. I have, however, sneaked in one more kind of gig in between London lockdowns.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/the-cosmos-with-professor-brian-cox-live-from-the-barbican">Brian Cox and the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican</a></strong><br />
I don&#8217;t usually include classical shows in these lists. To be honest, I don&#8217;t go to a lot of classical concerts as it&#8217;s mostly not my thing at all. But this was a bit different. Brian Cox gave some brief &#8220;mini-lectures&#8221; between classical pieces that had been chosen to tie in with the questions that he raised. It was a strange show. Probably about a quarter of the seats at the Barbican were used (they sold online tickets too), walking around the venue was very tightly controlled and there was no interval. They even expanded the stage into the stalls in order for the orchestra to be socially distanced. The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000qkl5">concert is available on the BBC web site</a> for a few weeks if you&#8217;d like to hear it.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what does 2021 hold? Well, it&#8217;s hard to be sure. I&#8217;ve got a fistful of tickets for shows that were postponed from 2020 but, at this point, I wouldn&#8217;t like to guess which ones I&#8217;ll actually get to see.</p>
<p>What about you? What did you get to see before the venues all closed down? What are your predictions for how things will go next year?</p>

              <h2><a href="https://perlhacks.com/2020/12/replacing-cpan-rt/">Replacing CPAN RT</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>[<strong>Update:</strong> the CPAN Request Tracker was saved. It’s now run by a new team of volunteers and none of my suggestions below are required.]</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, we learned that the <a href="https://log.perl.org/2020/12/rtcpanorg-sunset.html">CPAN Request Tracker was closing down early next year</a>. I proposed <a href="https://perlhacks.com/2020/12/rt-action-plan-for-cpan-authors/">a plan that CPAN authors could follow</a> to ensure that their users can still find somewhere to report bugs in modules (and, perhaps more importantly, to see what bugs have already been reported in modules).</p>
<p>But that’s only part of the problem. In fact, it’s probably a minor part of the problem. If you’re an active CPAN author, then you probably already knew about the impending closure and had already made plans to deal with it. It’s likely that you had already moved your bug tracking to a new system. At the very least, you now know what the problem is and are considering the best way to deal with it before next March.</p>
<p>The far larger problem is the thousands of distributions that aren’t owned by active CPAN authors. What are we going to do about those?</p>
<p>How big is the problem? Well, the site <a href="https://cpan.rocks/">cpan.rocks</a> displays stats about CPAN. One of the panels on its front page shows a summary of the bugtracker information in CPAN distribution. You’ll see that 24,873 distributions (that’s 66% of them) have no bugtracker information included in their metadata. That’ll be for a number of reasons. Some of them will be distributions that haven’t been updated since alternative bugtrackers were supported by CPAN (originally, it was just assumed that everyone used the CPAN RT); some of them will be because the authors don’t know how to add the required metadata; and some of them (including most of my distributions) are missing it because the author just hasn’t got round to adding it yet. There will, of course, be many more reasons.</p>
<p>Some people will have read the recent news and will be galvanised into doing something about it (I fall firmly into that category) but others (and I’d suggest that it’s a large majority) either won’t hear about the change or won’t care about it. And why should they care? They were generous enough to donate some of their code to CPAN at some point. They don’t have any obligation at all to carry on maintaining it after they’ve lost interest in whatever project led to them writing that software.</p>
<p>Take, for example, <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Mail-Alias">Mail-Alias</a>. That was released by someone called Tom Zeltwanger twenty years ago. He released three versions over a period of two months and then stopped. Who knows why. When he last updated the module, the CPAN search engine didn’t support alternative bugtrackers, so he never considered adding one. And that meant that the CPAN page for his module linked to the default bugtracker set up for the distribution on the CPAN RT. In the last fifteen years, <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Mail-Alias">four bugs have been reported</a> against that module. But as Tom has moved on, nothing has been done about any of them. There are a lot of modules on CPAN in a similar situation.</p>
<p>But that leaves <a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> (the current CPAN search engine) with a problem. Where does it send people who want to report a bug against an inactive module?</p>
<p>You might think that it doesn’t matter. But I disagree. Maybe I think that Mail::Alias would be the perfect module for a project I’m working on. Even before I start using it, it’s useful to be able to browse any existing bugs to see how they might affect my use of the module. And if someone later comes along and wants to take over maintenance of the module, then it’s useful for them to see any bugs that have been raised during the hiatus when the module was unmaintained.</p>
<p>So, I’m a big fan of having a default bugtracker for CPAN modules – even for ones with inactive authors. Which leads us to the question of where should that be. And I have a suggestion.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Micheal Schwern and Olaf Alders set up <a href="https://github.com/gitpan">Gitpan</a>. It’s an organisation which has a Github repo for every distribution on CPAN. And those repos each have a commit for every release of those distributions. Here, for example, is <a href="https://github.com/gitpan/Mail-Alias">the repo for Mail-Alias</a> – and you can see the three commits for the three releases I mentioned above.</p>
<p>So I’d like to suggest Gitpan as a suitable place to use as a default bugtracker for CPAN distributions. There are a couple of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks like the auto-population of the commits stopped a few years ago. We’d need to work out how that works and catch up on the recent uploads.</li>
<li>None of the repos has the issue tracker turned on. But I expect that can be done with a relatively simple program that uses the GitHub API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we also have the problem that some people object to using GitHub since it was taken over by Microsoft. But that’s fine, they can just point their bugtracker metadata to their preferred system.</p>
<p>The problem with the CPAN RT was that it needed too much maintenance – and the Perl NOC team is really overworked. Any self-hosted alternative seems likely to have the same problem eventually. So I’m all in favour of using a third-party alternative. And if you’re taking that route, then it makes sense (to me, at least) to use a third-party system that already has all (ok, most) of the repos set up.</p>
<p>I haven’t spoken to Schwern or Olaf about this, so I don’t know if there was some major problem that would stop this plan from working. But I think it’s worth looking at.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://perlhacks.com/2020/12/rt-action-plan-for-cpan-authors/">RT – Action Plan for CPAN Authors</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://log.perl.org/2020/12/rtcpanorg-sunset.html">CPAN RT is going away.</a> CPAN authors have until the beginning of March to extract any useful information from it.</p>
<p>RT is the “Request Tracker”, a bug tracking system that is written by <a href="https://bestpractical.com/">Best Practical</a>. For almost as long as I can remember, anyone who uploads a module to <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> gets a free ticket queue for their module at <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/">rt.cpan.org</a>. <a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> assumes that’s where people should report bugs in your module and helpfully adds an “issues” link that goes to the appropriate page in RT.</p>
<p>But now that system is going away. It will be switched off on the 1st March 2021. The <a href="https://noc.perl.org/">Perl NOC team</a> is spread pretty thinly and they just don’t have the resources to keep it running.</p>
<p>Gabor has published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ly28Ew0spY">a video talking about what this means and some of the potential problems</a>. But I thought it would be useful to work on a list of things that CPAN authors should be thinking about over the next three months.</p>
<p>Firstly, and most importantly, you’ll need somewhere new for people to report problems with your modules. For most people, that’ll be simple enough. If you host your code repos somewhere like GitHub, then you could just use the issue trackers that most of those services provide. If you host your own code repos (or don’t have public code repos), then you’ll need to find an alternative solution.</p>
<p>Next you’ll need to tell people where to find your new bug tracker. You do this by adding it to the metadata for your CPAN distribution. If, like most people, you provide a Makefile.PL in your distribution, then you’ll want to add a snippet like this to your code:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">META_MERGE        =&gt; {
  'meta-spec' =&gt; { version =&gt; 2 },
  resources =&gt; {
    bugtracker =&gt; {
      "web" =&gt; "https://github.com/davorg/moox-role-json_ld/issues"
    }
 },</pre><p>It’s likely that you already have a “resources” key in your data structure (containing, for example, a link to your code repo), in which case you just need to add the “bugtracker” key inside it. When you release this new update to CPAN, the “issues” link will change to point to your new bug tracker.</p>
<p>You then have the problem of dealing with the tickets that are currently in your RT queues. I suggest one or more of the following strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go through the list and fix any that can be easily fixed. I found two like that when looking through my list this morning. If you’re releasing new versions of the modules (to add the new bug tracker information) then you might as well fix a bug or two at the same time.</li>
<li>Look for tickets that can be closed. My list contains some very old tickets. I mean like fifteen years old. If someone had a problem installing one of your modules fifteen years ago and hasn’t followed-up more recently, then there’s a good chance that they no longer care about the solution. What I’ve been doing is to check on <a href="https://www.cpantesters.org/">CPAN Testers</a> to see if anyone else has seen a similar problem. If I see other reports, I know that it’s something that needs to be fixed. If there’s just the one in RT, then I close it with a message saying (paraphrased) “if this is still a problem that you’d like me to investigate, then please open a new ticket at [link to new bug tracker]”.</li>
<li>Then you’re left with the tickets that you’d still like to address at some point. The Perl NOC team say that they’ll probably make a static archive of the old RT tickets available. But it would be good to get those tickets over to your new bug tracker. As I’m using GitHub for my new bug trackers, and that’s currently the most popular solution other than the CPAN RT itself, I’m hoping that someone cleverer than me will write some code that will make moving the tickets easy. But if nothing happens before the end of January, I might have to look into that myself.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve got a bit of work to do in this area myself. Although I’ve been using GitHub for all of my CPAN code for a long time, I haven’t been advertising the fact that I’d prefer people to use GitHub for bug reporting too. So I need to update all of my modules with the new bug tracker information included. I’ll do that over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>I have a couple of tools that might help in this process. Firstly, I’ve just added to <a href="https://cpandashboard.com/">CPAN Dashboard</a> a column that links to the module’s bug tracker if one exists. I can use that to know which modules need to be updated.</p>
<p>You could <a href="https://cpandashboard.com/add/">add yourself to CPAN Dashboard</a> if you wanted to get that information for your modules. But if you don’t want to do that, I’ve written a really short program that you can use to find your CPAN distributions that don’t include the bug tracker information.<a href="https://gist.github.com/davorg/faab75c5f40c9a580aa532f441442eb6"> It’s available as a Gist.</a></p>
<p>Have I missed anything? I mean, yes, I know there are a large number of unmaintained CPAN distributions that no-one will get round to updating. But this post was aimed at active CPAN authors. If there’s anything else you think we should be doing, then please let me know in the comments.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Blog posts are like busses. You wait months for one and then two come along on consecutive days!</p>
<p><a href="https://perlhacks.com/2020/09/blogging-for-perl/">Yesterday I wrote</a> about how we didn’t need a blogging platform for the Perl community – all we really needed was a good-looking feed aggregator. I mentioned <a href="http://perlsphere.net/">Perlsphere</a> as one such aggregator.</p>
<p>Then Matthew commented, saying that Perlsphere looked a bit broken as Dave Cantrell’s posts from a few years ago frequently pop up there as new posts. I had a quick look at the problem and couldn’t quite work out what was going on. His web feed seems valid, but Perlsphere didn’t seem to recognise the dates of the posts.</p>
<p>Perlsphere is implemented using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Plagger">Plagger</a>, a feed aggregator written by Miyagawa a very long time ago (back when it seemed that web feeds were going to conquer the world). It’s a pretty complex beast and it seemed possible that somewhere deep in its code, it was mis-parsing Dave’s web feed. So I cloned <a href="https://github.com/miyagawa/plagger">the repo</a> and tried to work out what was going on.</p>
<p>But Plagger hasn’t been updated for a very long time. As you can see from the <a href="http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=Plagger+0.7.17">test results</a>, it stopped passing its tests a long while ago (I suspect when the current directory was removed from @INC). I spent a brief time trying to get it working but, ultimately, decided it was too hard a job.</p>
<p>So I took another look at Perlsphere. And I decided that if it’s based on bit-rotten software, it’s not going to be very easy to maintain (which gave me flashbacks to blogs.perl.org!)</p>
<p>But there’s another Perl tool for aggregating web feeds. And I wrote it. It’s called <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Perlanet">Perlanet</a> (and, boy, do I regret that name now). Back in the first decade of this millennium, I was fascinated by web feeds and the idea of using them to build local “planets” – a web site that aggregated web feeds that had interesting information about your local area. Of course, that was back in the days when everything had a web feed and it was simple enough to pull them together and create really quite interesting sites. These days, of course, web feeds are rather unfashionable and almost no-one thinks to add them on to their web site.</p>
<p>However, they still cling to life in the world of blogging. Mainly, I suspect, because blogging platforms added them fifteen years ago and just haven’t bothered to remove them yet. And it’s blog posts that we’re interested in here – so we’re still in with a chance of building something useful.</p>
<p>And that’s what I did over lunch. I give you <a href="http://perl.theplanetarium.org/">Planet Perl</a>, a new site for aggregating Perl blogs.</p>
<p>Currently, it only has four blogs in the configuration. But <a href="https://github.com/davorg/planetperl/blob/master/perlanetrc">the config file is on Github</a> and I’ll be happy to get pull requests adding other blogs.</p>
<p>I hope you find it useful.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://perlhacks.com/2020/09/blogging-for-perl/">Blogging for Perl</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>I think it was at YAPC Copenhagen in 2008 that a small group of us first discussed the idea of building a shared blogging platform for the Perl community. It was over a year later that we launched <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/">blogs.perl.org</a>.</p>
<p>I remember a lot of discussions over that time where we tried to thrash out exactly what we wanted to build. I know that one of my main drivers was that I wanted to replace the journals feature of use.perl. For those of you too young to remember, use.perl was a Perl community web site from the dawn of time. The site ran Perl news on its front page, but users could also have their own journal. For a few years, we had a nice little blogging community on the site. It used the same software as <a href="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> and, like Slashdot, was looking pretty dated at the time. I remember being particularly disappointed that you couldn’t put images in a journal entry.</p>
<p>So that was certainly where I started from when planning blogs.perl.org. I wanted a modern blogging platform to replace use.perl. Other people wanted slightly different things. At least one person argued strongly that what we really needed was a nice-looking blog aggregator and that people could do their actual blogging on their own sites (or some other blog provider).</p>
<p>But, as you can see, that point of view lost out and we implemented a full blogging system using <a href="https://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>.</p>
<p>Ten years on, I think that was a mistake. I think that having a community blogging platform for Perl is actively harmful to Perl.</p>
<p>I’ll explain why a bit later, but first let’s talk through a bit of more recent history of the site.</p>
<p>It’s well-known, I think, that the site is not is a good state. I’m happy to explain what happened there, but it’s a long and rather dull story. There have been a couple of attempts to build replacement systems but they both stalled before they were complete.</p>
<p>So we’re left in a situation where the site is broken and no-one really has the time or the expertise to fix it. And attempts to replace it seem doomed to failure.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I decided that the situation was untenable and that I wanted to close the site down. I spoke to Aaron and he pretty much agreed with me. We decided that we’d give people plenty of notice to take their blogging elsewhere and, rather than closing the site completely, we would make it read-only (so all the existing content would still be there). We ran the idea past the rest of the loose “management team” and <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/aristotle/">Aristotle</a> spoke up, saying that he would rather take the site over himself and try to improve matters. And that’s what happened. Over the last few months, Aaron and I have extricated ourselves from running the site and it’s all now handled by Aristotle.</p>
<p>I wish him all the best in those endeavours and really hope he manages to make the site better than it was (he’s already making great progress in removing loads of old spam blogs from the site).</p>
<p>But, really, I think that my original plan was a better idea. I don’t want people to blog about Perl on a Perl community site. I want people to blog about Perl on sites where people blog about other languages and technologies.</p>
<p>I’ve been giving talks about the need for the Perl community to break out of its echo chamber for almost as long as I’ve been part of the community. But I think it’s important. It’s a kind of low-key marketing. If you’re talking about your cool Perl project on a Perl community web site then only people who are looking for Perl articles will find it. But if you blog about it on a general programming web site then a) you’ll get a far bigger audience and b) some of that audience might say “oh! I never knew Perl could do that – perhaps I’ll give it a closer look.”</p>
<p>And that’s why I think blogs.perl.org (and, probably, use.perl before it) are harmful to Perl. It encourages Perl bloggers to blog for the Perl community – when it would be far better to get your blog posts in front of more people. Perl people will still read your Perl posts (through <a href="http://perlsphere.net/">Perlsphere</a> perhaps, or post the link to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/">/r/perl</a> or the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity">Perl Community Facebook group</a>) but other people will see them too. On blogs.perl.org, you’re pretty much guaranteed that only Perl programmers will see your posts.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t understand why people still use blogs.perl.org. Until Aristotle’s work bears fruit it’s painfully broken. What do you get that’s worth putting yourself through all of that pain? Why not just blog somewhere else and submit your web feed to Perlsphere? Or blog where other programmers blog – somewhere like <a href="https://dev.to/">dev.to</a>, perhaps (I’ve started publishing <a href="https://dev.to/davorg">my more technical blog posts</a> there).</p>
<p>I think it will be great if Aristotle gets blogs.perl.org working well. I really want that to happen. But it would be even better if he didn’t have to. If people stopped using it; if they went off and started spreading their interesting Perl blog posts all over the web.</p>
<p>Break out of the echo chamber. Find yourself a bigger audience. Spread the word beyond the Perl community.</p>
<p>Or, alternatively, explain to me why it’s so vital that the Perl community has its own centralised blogging platform.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>What do you do when you’re stuck inside because Coronavirus means that your country is in lockdown? Well, you write a book, of course. Or, to be more accurate, you cobble together fifty or so old blog posts into a book.</p>
<p>So that’s what I’ve done. Now you can read some of your favourite Perl Hacks blog posts in a handy Kindle book. Other ebook marketplaces are, of course, available – but I haven’t had the time to make a version that’s available from anywhere else yet. That might follow if enough people ask for it.</p>
<p>The book is, predictably, called <em>The Best of Perl Hacks</em> and it’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2RixX0k">available from Amazon now</a> (that link goes to the UK store, but it should be available on all Amazon sites).</p>
<p>Please buy it, read it and let me know what you think.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Here are brief descriptions of the various cultural things I did in the second half of January 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Food: 12:51 (Islington, 2020-01-18)</strong></p>
<p>Our second visit to <a href="https://www.1251.co.uk/">12:51</a>, but the first time we tried the tasting menu. It&#8217;s a bit pricy (£75 a head, I think) but it&#8217;s well worth it. The food was wonderful. And on the night we were there, James Cochran (the chef who owns the restaurant) was there &#8211; although he was serving, rather than being in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Food: Wolkite Kitfo (Holloway, 2020-01-24)</strong></p>
<p>This is an Ethiopian restaurant near Arsenal&#8217;s new stadium. Ethiopian food is really interesting. It&#8217;s usually served piled up on a flatbread called injera. You then tear off bits of the injera and use it to scoop up bits of the food and put it in your mouth. So the injera doubles as both plate and cutlery. If you&#8217;re interested (and I think you should be) then this is a nice local restaurant in which to try it.</p>
<p><strong>Art: 24/7 (Somerset House, 2020-01-29)</strong></p>
<p>The subtitle for <a href="https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/247">this exhibition</a> is &#8220;A wake-up call for our non-stop world&#8221;. The pieces here all examine the way that the world has changed over the last twenty years so we are now all more connected much more of the time and how that has affected us. It&#8217;s a very thought-provoking exhibition and I highly recommend you seeing it.</p>
<p><strong>Film: The Personal History of David Copperfield (Screen on the Green, 2020-01-29)</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never read <em>David Copperfield</em>. I don&#8217;t remember even seeing another film or TV adaptation. So I was probably one of very few people in the cinema who didn&#8217;t know the plot. And, therefore, I have no idea how much this film deviates from the book. It certainly feels like a rather modern take on the book (although it&#8217;s very much set in the nineteenth century). There&#8217;s a great cast and a cracking script. I loved it.</p>
<p><strong>Gig: John Grant (Roundhouse, 2020-01-29)</strong></p>
<p>I love John Grant&#8217;s music and see him live whenever I can (I already have a ticket to see him again at the start of May). This gig was part of the Roundhouse&#8217;s &#8220;In the Round&#8221; where artists play to an all-seated audience. This was a stripped-back set (just John on piano and a keyboard player) which meant that some of his more complex songs were skipped. But he played everything I wanted to hear &#8211; even finishing with a great version of &#8220;Chicken Bones&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Gig: Hate Moss (Old Blue Last, 2020-01-30)</strong></p>
<p>It is many years since I was last at the Old Blue Last for a gig. I was drawn back by an old friend who was first on the bill, playing as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj-S1swulLxU5_pXYR_6pbw">M-Orchestra</a>. I stayed on to see the other two acts. Kill Your Boyfriends were a bit noisy for my tastes, but Hate Moss were well worth staying out for. I&#8217;ll be looking out for them playing London again.</p>
<p><strong>Dance: Sadlers Wells Sampled (Sadlers Wells, 2020-01-31)</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in London for over 35 years and I&#8217;ve never been to Sadlers Wells. And if you&#8217;re going to fix that, then it makes good sense to go on a night where there&#8217;s a selection of different types of dance on display. There were eight different acts during the night &#8211; from traditional Indian dance and tango to really experimental dance from Company Wayne McGregor and Géométrie Variable. I&#8217;m no expert in dance and this was a great introduction to the breadth of options available.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>I want to do more blogging this year. So one thing I&#8217;m going to do is to write about the cultural experiences that I have. My plan is to write short reviews of any films, plays, exhibitions and lectures that I go to. To start us off, here&#8217;s what I did in the first half of January.</p>
<p><strong>Film: Last Christmas (Vue Islington, 2020-01-01)</strong></p>
<p>Yes, this got some terrible reviews, but cheesy romcoms are a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine. This isn&#8217;t up to the standards of <em>Four Weddings and a Funeral</em> or <em>Notting Hill</em>, but I really enjoyed it. And I don&#8217;t care how much you judge me for that.</p>
<p><strong>Art: <a href="https://www.thewonderfactory.co.uk/">Wonder Factory</a> (Dalston Works, 2020-01-03)</strong></p>
<p>This was weird. Fifteen rooms have been turned into Instagram-friendly art installations. They are of variable quality, but the best installations (like the marshmallow swimming pool) are very good. It&#8217;s only around until early February (and it seems they&#8217;re now only opening at the weekend) so you should get along to see it soon.</p>
<p><strong>Film: Jojo Rabbit (Screen on the Green, 2020-01-05)</strong></p>
<p>The Hitler Youth isn&#8217;t the most obvious subject for comedy, but this film manages to pull it off brilliantly. It&#8217;s obviously a very delicate balance but director, Taika Waititi, gets it spot on &#8211; while also playing a very funny imaginary Adolf Hitler. I see this has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar; and that&#8217;s well-deserved.</p>
<p><strong>VR: Doctor Who &#8211; Edge of Time (<a href="https://other.world/">Other World</a>, 2020-01-05)</strong></p>
<p>Other World is a virtual reality arcade in Haggerston and currently, one of the VR experiences they are offering is the Doctor Who game, <em>Edge of Time</em>. Players are put in their individual pods and loaded up with all their VR equipment (headset, headphones and a controller for each hand) by staff before being left alone to help the Thirteenth Doctor save the universe. I confess I got a bit stuck trying to get the Tardis to dematerialise, but I really enjoyed myself and am very tempted to go back for another try.</p>
<p><strong>Play: A Kind of People (<a href="https://royalcourttheatre.com/">Royal Court Theatre</a>, 2020-01-06)</strong></p>
<p>The Royal Court has a brilliant scheme where they make tickets for Monday evening performances available for £12 each. That price makes it very tempting to see plays that you know nothing about. And that&#8217;s what we did for this. We really had no idea what this play was about. It turns out that it&#8217;s an investigation of the various prejudices (racism, sexism, class snobbery, &#8230;) that bubble under the surface of British society. I&#8217;d recommend you go and see it, but it closes in a couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting: Tech For UK Post-Election Debrief (Onfido Ltd, 2020-01-08)</strong></p>
<p>I want to get along to more tech meet-ups this year and this was my first. Tech For UK is a group of techies who volunteer their time to build tools that increase democratic engagement in the UK. You can see some examples at <a href="https://voter.tools/">voter.tools</a> (this includes my site &#8211; <a href="https://twittelection.co.uk/">TwittElection</a>). This meeting was a discussion about what the group had been doing during the election campaign and where they should focus their efforts in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Art: Bridgit Riley (<a href="https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/venues/hayward-gallery">Hayward Gallery</a>, 2020-01-15)</strong></p>
<p>I want to make more use of my South Bank membership, and this was a free after-hours, members&#8217; viewing of the exhibition. This is a retrospective of Riley&#8217;s whole career and, therefore, is a great introduction to the breadth of her work. She&#8217;s a fascinating artist (if one who occasionally produces art that can give you a bit of a headache). I recommend seeing the exhibition &#8211; but hurry, it closes on 26 January.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2020/01/2019-in-gigs.html">2019 in Gigs</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>It&#8217;s time that I wrote my now-traditional review of the gigs I saw last year.</p>
<p>It felt like I didn&#8217;t see so many gigs this year, but <a href="https://www.songkick.com/users/davorg/gigography">Songkick tells me</a> I saw 43 which was more than the previous year (but still some considerable way short of the 60 I saw in 2013). I&#8217;ll get to the best ones in a minute, but let&#8217;s talk about a few of the disappointments first.</p>
<p>The first gig I saw in the year was the Residents at the Union Chapel. I wasn&#8217;t really sure what I was expecting, but it was all a bit disjointed and amateur-sounding, so I left before very long. Having really enjoyed the Bananarama reunion tour a couple of years ago, I was looking forward to seeing them (now Siobhan-less) again, particularly at a lovely little venue like Omeara &#8211; but they were a terrible disappointment and wanted to play their new album instead of the hits that I wanted to hear. I really wanted to enjoy the post-Pete Shelley Buzzcocks show at the Albert Hall, but it was a lot like a third-rate Buzzcocks tribute band and I left quite a while before the end.</p>
<p>And here, in chronological order, are my ten favourite gigs of the year.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tears For Fears:</strong> This was postponed from the previous year. It takes a good band to make it worth going to the O2 Arena. And Tears for Fears certainly hit the spot.</li>
<li><strong>Desperate Journalist:</strong> An up and coming band that I really want to hear more from. Oh, and they were supported by She Makes War, who is always worth seeing.</li>
<li><strong>Grant:</strong> This was a slightly strange one. A night of Scandinavian music at the Lexington. We went because we wanted to see the first act, Moses Hightower (who were great). Grant was on next and she totally blew us away. I think we left soon after she finished.</li>
<li><strong>Stealing Sheep:</strong> I don&#8217;t get to see Stealing Sheep as often as I used too, but they were touring this year because of their new album. I saw them twice. I enjoyed the show at Earth in Dalston the most. That&#8217;s them in the photo above.</li>
<li><strong>Sleeper:</strong> I never got to see Sleeper back in the 90s. But I saw them twice this year. I think I just prefered the show at the 100 Club.</li>
<li><strong>Swimming Girls:</strong> I&#8217;ve seen Swimming Girls as a support act and really wanted to see them playing a headline show. I finally got to do that at the Lexington this year. And then they announced they were splitting up.</li>
<li><strong>Cut Copy:</strong> A band that I hadn&#8217;t heard of at the start of this year. But this show at Somerset House was great and I&#8217;d certainly see them again.</li>
<li><strong>Sunflower Bean:</strong> I always love seeing Sunflower Bean and this was at the Borderline (just before it closed down) and I thought the days of seeing them in venues this small were long past.</li>
<li><strong>Midge Ure:</strong> This was pure nostalgia. Midge Ure&#8217;s current band played all Visage&#8217;s first album and Ultravox&#8217;s &#8220;Vienna&#8221; &#8211; two albums that he recorded in 1980.</li>
<li><strong>Amanda Palmer:</strong> This wasn&#8217;t really a gig. It was more of a four-hour-long, intense psychotherapy session with occasional songs. I saw the prototype for this show in Edinburgh last year, but the full version was sensational.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just outside of this list are shows by Pale Waves, Lloyd Cole, Wildwood Kin and OMD.</p>
<p>Oh, and I have a new regular gig-going companion this year. I asked her what her favourite gig of the year was and she voted for the Grant show at the Lexington.</p>
<p>2020 is already shaping up well. I have tickets to see John Grant (twice), Tove Lo and Ladytron. And there&#8217;s some heavyweight nostalgia coming &#8211; with gigs by the Pet Shop Boys and Bauhaus.</p>
<p>What about you? What live music did you really enjoy in 2019?</p>
