              <h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2022/01/2021-in-gigs.html">2021 in Gigs</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>A little later than usual, here&#8217;s my review of the gigs I saw last year.</p>
<p>In 2020, I saw four gigs. In 2021, I almost doubled that to seven. Obviously, we spent a lot of the year with most music venues closed, so those few gigs I saw were all in the second half of the year. Usually, I&#8217;d list my top ten gigs. This year (as last year) I&#8217;ll be listing them all. So here they are in chronological order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39755096-mike-oldfield-at-royal-festival-hall-southbank-centre">Tubular Bells at the Royal Festival Hall</a></strong><br />
This was a strange show for several reasons. Firstly, it was advertised as commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of <em>Tubular Bells</em>. But the album was released in 1973, so it was two years early (apparently it was the fiftieth anniversary of when Mike Oldfield started writing the piece). Secondly, Mike Oldfield wasn&#8217;t performing &#8211; but you needed to examine the publicity very carefully to work that out. And thirdly, there was a troupe of acrobats that were pointlessly leaping around the stage while the musicians played. All in all, I thought this was slightly disappointing.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/38968289-heaven-17-at-roundhouse">Heaven 17 at the Roundhouse</a></strong><br />
Many of these shows were postponed from 2020. This was originally intended to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Human League album, <em>Travelogue</em>, but it ended but being the forty-first anniversary. But none of that mattered. This was Heaven 17 playing all of the first two Human League albums and it was absolutely wonderful. Apparently, they had invited Phil Oakey to take part, but he wasn&#8217;t interested. That&#8217;s Heaven 17 in the photo above.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39828850-lump-at-scala">LUMP at the Scala</a></strong><br />
LUMP is Laura Marling playing with Tunng&#8217;s Mike Lindsay. I kinda assumed that their first album was going to be a one-off, but they produced a second album in 2020. This was the first gig I&#8217;d been to in a cramped venue like the Scala for a couple of years and it all got a bit too much for me. I really didn&#8217;t enjoy the atmosphere and left during the third or fourth song. I still love the album though and I hope to build up my tolerance for gig crowds over the coming months.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39773071-staves-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire">The Staves at Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Empire</a></strong><br />
Actually, this was only two-thirds of the Staves. One of the sisters has has a baby recently and has decided to sit out tours for a couple of years. But the two remaining sisters still put on a great show.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39786793-laura-marling-at-roundhouse">Laura Marling at the Roundhouse</a></strong><br />
Given how few gigs I saw last year, it&#8217;s surprising how repetitive they were. Here&#8217;s Laura Marling again (and the Roundhouse again!) Although she has yet to match the heights of the <em>Short Movie</em> tour, Laura Marling is always worth seeing and this show was no exception.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39662320-heaven-17-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire">Heaven 17 at the Shepherd&#8217;s Bush</a></strong><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39662320-heaven-17-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire"> Empire</a></strong><br />
More repetition. I think the two Heaven 17 gigs were originally supposed to be several months apart, but the vagaries of the Covid scheduling changes led to them being just two months apart. This one celebrated the fortieth (actually forty-first) anniversary of Heaven 17 starting and was a glorious journey through their back catalogue. Oh, and the support was Pete Wylie, so I can finally say I&#8217;ve seen all three members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucial_Three">Crucial Three</a> live.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39709208-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-at-eventim-apollo">Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark at Hammersmith Apollo</a></strong><br />
OMD are just one of those bands that I see live whenever I can. I&#8217;ve now been seeing them for over forty years (since they supported Gary Numan in 1980). They have such a massive back catalogue that they can just play hit after hit for two hours. But this show was a bit different as they started by playing all of their 1981 album, <em>Architecture and Morality</em>. They were as good as I&#8217;ve ever seen them.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that was 2021. What will happen in 2022? Well, I have tickets for a dozen or shows but who knows how many of them I&#8217;ll actually see? I&#8217;ve already had emails postponing the Wolf Alice and Peter Hook shows I was going to see this month. I guess I&#8217;ll just have to wait and see how the rest of the year pans out.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2020/12/2020-in-gigs.html">2020 in Gigs</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>At about this time of the year, I usually write an overview of the gigs I&#8217;ve seen in the year. The post always starts with me saying how many gigs I&#8217;ve seen during the year. This is the tenth year I&#8217;ve been writing these posts and in that time I&#8217;ve seen between 35 (<a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2018/12/2018-in-gigs.html">2018</a>) and 60 (<a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2013/12/2013-gigs.html">2013</a>) gigs in a year.</p>
<p>This year, I&#8217;ve seen four gigs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to add in a strange gig-cum-lecture that I saw a couple of weeks ago in order to list the top five gigs I saw this year. Here they are in chronological order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39231390-john-grant-at-roundhouse">John Grant at the Roundhouse</a></strong><br />
This is the second time I&#8217;ve seen John Grant live. The first time (at the Hammersmith Apollo a few years ago) he had a full band with him, but this time it was just him and a pianist. It was a great start to my gig-going year. I also had a ticket to see him at Alexandra Palace later in the year, but that show has already been postponed twice.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39134185-hate-moss-at-old-blue-last">Hate Moss at the Old Blue Last</a></strong><br />
I don&#8217;t go to the Old Blue Last enough. It&#8217;s a tiny room above a pub in Shoreditch and every time I go there I have a really good time. This time I was drawn there because one of the support acts (<a href="https://m-orchestra.com/">M-orchestra</a>) is an old colleague from the BBC who had just started gigging again after a long hiatus. He was great (check out his streams on Facebook) and the fact that the other two acts on the bill were also very good was a bonus.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/38135579-ladytron-at-heaven">Ladytron at Heaven</a></strong><br />
Another show I went to because of the support act. I try to see <a href="https://stealingsheep.net/">Stealing Sheep</a> whenever I can so I bought a ticket for this just knowing they were on the bill. If you know anything about my musical taste then you&#8217;ll probably be surprised that I had never listened to Ladytron before buying the ticket. I investigated them before the gig and found an amazing band who I&#8217;ve been listening to a lot ever since. That&#8217;s Ladytron in the photo at the top of the page.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39140946-tove-lo-at-o2-forum-kentish-town">Tove Lo at the Forum</a></strong><br />
I saw Tove Lo at <a href="https://mightyhoopla.com/">Mighty Hoopla</a> in Brockwell Park in 2019. I&#8217;m not much of a festival fan but I enjoyed her and added her to my list of people to see indoors as soon as possible. This was that show and it was pretty enjoyable stuff, but subsequent events mean it has taken on rather more importance than it might otherwise have enjoyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I saw Tove Lo on March 12. Eleven days later, Boris Johnson put us in lockdown and my inbox turned into a sea of cancellations and postponements. I had a full schedule of upcoming gigs booked, but they&#8217;ve all been either cancelled or postponed until next year (or, in a couple of cases, 2022). I watched a couple of streamed gigs, but it&#8217;s really not the same at all. I have, however, sneaked in one more kind of gig in between London lockdowns.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/the-cosmos-with-professor-brian-cox-live-from-the-barbican">Brian Cox and the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican</a></strong><br />
I don&#8217;t usually include classical shows in these lists. To be honest, I don&#8217;t go to a lot of classical concerts as it&#8217;s mostly not my thing at all. But this was a bit different. Brian Cox gave some brief &#8220;mini-lectures&#8221; between classical pieces that had been chosen to tie in with the questions that he raised. It was a strange show. Probably about a quarter of the seats at the Barbican were used (they sold online tickets too), walking around the venue was very tightly controlled and there was no interval. They even expanded the stage into the stalls in order for the orchestra to be socially distanced. The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000qkl5">concert is available on the BBC web site</a> for a few weeks if you&#8217;d like to hear it.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what does 2021 hold? Well, it&#8217;s hard to be sure. I&#8217;ve got a fistful of tickets for shows that were postponed from 2020 but, at this point, I wouldn&#8217;t like to guess which ones I&#8217;ll actually get to see.</p>
<p>What about you? What did you get to see before the venues all closed down? What are your predictions for how things will go next year?</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>Here are brief descriptions of the various cultural things I did in the second half of January 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Food: 12:51 (Islington, 2020-01-18)</strong></p>
<p>Our second visit to <a href="https://www.1251.co.uk/">12:51</a>, but the first time we tried the tasting menu. It&#8217;s a bit pricy (£75 a head, I think) but it&#8217;s well worth it. The food was wonderful. And on the night we were there, James Cochran (the chef who owns the restaurant) was there &#8211; although he was serving, rather than being in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Food: Wolkite Kitfo (Holloway, 2020-01-24)</strong></p>
<p>This is an Ethiopian restaurant near Arsenal&#8217;s new stadium. Ethiopian food is really interesting. It&#8217;s usually served piled up on a flatbread called injera. You then tear off bits of the injera and use it to scoop up bits of the food and put it in your mouth. So the injera doubles as both plate and cutlery. If you&#8217;re interested (and I think you should be) then this is a nice local restaurant in which to try it.</p>
<p><strong>Art: 24/7 (Somerset House, 2020-01-29)</strong></p>
<p>The subtitle for <a href="https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/247">this exhibition</a> is &#8220;A wake-up call for our non-stop world&#8221;. The pieces here all examine the way that the world has changed over the last twenty years so we are now all more connected much more of the time and how that has affected us. It&#8217;s a very thought-provoking exhibition and I highly recommend you seeing it.</p>
<p><strong>Film: The Personal History of David Copperfield (Screen on the Green, 2020-01-29)</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never read <em>David Copperfield</em>. I don&#8217;t remember even seeing another film or TV adaptation. So I was probably one of very few people in the cinema who didn&#8217;t know the plot. And, therefore, I have no idea how much this film deviates from the book. It certainly feels like a rather modern take on the book (although it&#8217;s very much set in the nineteenth century). There&#8217;s a great cast and a cracking script. I loved it.</p>
<p><strong>Gig: John Grant (Roundhouse, 2020-01-29)</strong></p>
<p>I love John Grant&#8217;s music and see him live whenever I can (I already have a ticket to see him again at the start of May). This gig was part of the Roundhouse&#8217;s &#8220;In the Round&#8221; where artists play to an all-seated audience. This was a stripped-back set (just John on piano and a keyboard player) which meant that some of his more complex songs were skipped. But he played everything I wanted to hear &#8211; even finishing with a great version of &#8220;Chicken Bones&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Gig: Hate Moss (Old Blue Last, 2020-01-30)</strong></p>
<p>It is many years since I was last at the Old Blue Last for a gig. I was drawn back by an old friend who was first on the bill, playing as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj-S1swulLxU5_pXYR_6pbw">M-Orchestra</a>. I stayed on to see the other two acts. Kill Your Boyfriends were a bit noisy for my tastes, but Hate Moss were well worth staying out for. I&#8217;ll be looking out for them playing London again.</p>
<p><strong>Dance: Sadlers Wells Sampled (Sadlers Wells, 2020-01-31)</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in London for over 35 years and I&#8217;ve never been to Sadlers Wells. And if you&#8217;re going to fix that, then it makes good sense to go on a night where there&#8217;s a selection of different types of dance on display. There were eight different acts during the night &#8211; from traditional Indian dance and tango to really experimental dance from Company Wayne McGregor and Géométrie Variable. I&#8217;m no expert in dance and this was a great introduction to the breadth of options available.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>I want to do more blogging this year. So one thing I&#8217;m going to do is to write about the cultural experiences that I have. My plan is to write short reviews of any films, plays, exhibitions and lectures that I go to. To start us off, here&#8217;s what I did in the first half of January.</p>
<p><strong>Film: Last Christmas (Vue Islington, 2020-01-01)</strong></p>
<p>Yes, this got some terrible reviews, but cheesy romcoms are a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine. This isn&#8217;t up to the standards of <em>Four Weddings and a Funeral</em> or <em>Notting Hill</em>, but I really enjoyed it. And I don&#8217;t care how much you judge me for that.</p>
<p><strong>Art: <a href="https://www.thewonderfactory.co.uk/">Wonder Factory</a> (Dalston Works, 2020-01-03)</strong></p>
<p>This was weird. Fifteen rooms have been turned into Instagram-friendly art installations. They are of variable quality, but the best installations (like the marshmallow swimming pool) are very good. It&#8217;s only around until early February (and it seems they&#8217;re now only opening at the weekend) so you should get along to see it soon.</p>
<p><strong>Film: Jojo Rabbit (Screen on the Green, 2020-01-05)</strong></p>
<p>The Hitler Youth isn&#8217;t the most obvious subject for comedy, but this film manages to pull it off brilliantly. It&#8217;s obviously a very delicate balance but director, Taika Waititi, gets it spot on &#8211; while also playing a very funny imaginary Adolf Hitler. I see this has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar; and that&#8217;s well-deserved.</p>
<p><strong>VR: Doctor Who &#8211; Edge of Time (<a href="https://other.world/">Other World</a>, 2020-01-05)</strong></p>
<p>Other World is a virtual reality arcade in Haggerston and currently, one of the VR experiences they are offering is the Doctor Who game, <em>Edge of Time</em>. Players are put in their individual pods and loaded up with all their VR equipment (headset, headphones and a controller for each hand) by staff before being left alone to help the Thirteenth Doctor save the universe. I confess I got a bit stuck trying to get the Tardis to dematerialise, but I really enjoyed myself and am very tempted to go back for another try.</p>
<p><strong>Play: A Kind of People (<a href="https://royalcourttheatre.com/">Royal Court Theatre</a>, 2020-01-06)</strong></p>
<p>The Royal Court has a brilliant scheme where they make tickets for Monday evening performances available for £12 each. That price makes it very tempting to see plays that you know nothing about. And that&#8217;s what we did for this. We really had no idea what this play was about. It turns out that it&#8217;s an investigation of the various prejudices (racism, sexism, class snobbery, &#8230;) that bubble under the surface of British society. I&#8217;d recommend you go and see it, but it closes in a couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting: Tech For UK Post-Election Debrief (Onfido Ltd, 2020-01-08)</strong></p>
<p>I want to get along to more tech meet-ups this year and this was my first. Tech For UK is a group of techies who volunteer their time to build tools that increase democratic engagement in the UK. You can see some examples at <a href="https://voter.tools/">voter.tools</a> (this includes my site &#8211; <a href="https://twittelection.co.uk/">TwittElection</a>). This meeting was a discussion about what the group had been doing during the election campaign and where they should focus their efforts in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Art: Bridgit Riley (<a href="https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/venues/hayward-gallery">Hayward Gallery</a>, 2020-01-15)</strong></p>
<p>I want to make more use of my South Bank membership, and this was a free after-hours, members&#8217; viewing of the exhibition. This is a retrospective of Riley&#8217;s whole career and, therefore, is a great introduction to the breadth of her work. She&#8217;s a fascinating artist (if one who occasionally produces art that can give you a bit of a headache). I recommend seeing the exhibition &#8211; but hurry, it closes on 26 January.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2020/01/2019-in-gigs.html">2019 in Gigs</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>It&#8217;s time that I wrote my now-traditional review of the gigs I saw last year.</p>
<p>It felt like I didn&#8217;t see so many gigs this year, but <a href="https://www.songkick.com/users/davorg/gigography">Songkick tells me</a> I saw 43 which was more than the previous year (but still some considerable way short of the 60 I saw in 2013). I&#8217;ll get to the best ones in a minute, but let&#8217;s talk about a few of the disappointments first.</p>
<p>The first gig I saw in the year was the Residents at the Union Chapel. I wasn&#8217;t really sure what I was expecting, but it was all a bit disjointed and amateur-sounding, so I left before very long. Having really enjoyed the Bananarama reunion tour a couple of years ago, I was looking forward to seeing them (now Siobhan-less) again, particularly at a lovely little venue like Omeara &#8211; but they were a terrible disappointment and wanted to play their new album instead of the hits that I wanted to hear. I really wanted to enjoy the post-Pete Shelley Buzzcocks show at the Albert Hall, but it was a lot like a third-rate Buzzcocks tribute band and I left quite a while before the end.</p>
<p>And here, in chronological order, are my ten favourite gigs of the year.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tears For Fears:</strong> This was postponed from the previous year. It takes a good band to make it worth going to the O2 Arena. And Tears for Fears certainly hit the spot.</li>
<li><strong>Desperate Journalist:</strong> An up and coming band that I really want to hear more from. Oh, and they were supported by She Makes War, who is always worth seeing.</li>
<li><strong>Grant:</strong> This was a slightly strange one. A night of Scandinavian music at the Lexington. We went because we wanted to see the first act, Moses Hightower (who were great). Grant was on next and she totally blew us away. I think we left soon after she finished.</li>
<li><strong>Stealing Sheep:</strong> I don&#8217;t get to see Stealing Sheep as often as I used too, but they were touring this year because of their new album. I saw them twice. I enjoyed the show at Earth in Dalston the most. That&#8217;s them in the photo above.</li>
<li><strong>Sleeper:</strong> I never got to see Sleeper back in the 90s. But I saw them twice this year. I think I just prefered the show at the 100 Club.</li>
<li><strong>Swimming Girls:</strong> I&#8217;ve seen Swimming Girls as a support act and really wanted to see them playing a headline show. I finally got to do that at the Lexington this year. And then they announced they were splitting up.</li>
<li><strong>Cut Copy:</strong> A band that I hadn&#8217;t heard of at the start of this year. But this show at Somerset House was great and I&#8217;d certainly see them again.</li>
<li><strong>Sunflower Bean:</strong> I always love seeing Sunflower Bean and this was at the Borderline (just before it closed down) and I thought the days of seeing them in venues this small were long past.</li>
<li><strong>Midge Ure:</strong> This was pure nostalgia. Midge Ure&#8217;s current band played all Visage&#8217;s first album and Ultravox&#8217;s &#8220;Vienna&#8221; &#8211; two albums that he recorded in 1980.</li>
<li><strong>Amanda Palmer:</strong> This wasn&#8217;t really a gig. It was more of a four-hour-long, intense psychotherapy session with occasional songs. I saw the prototype for this show in Edinburgh last year, but the full version was sensational.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just outside of this list are shows by Pale Waves, Lloyd Cole, Wildwood Kin and OMD.</p>
<p>Oh, and I have a new regular gig-going companion this year. I asked her what her favourite gig of the year was and she voted for the Grant show at the Lexington.</p>
<p>2020 is already shaping up well. I have tickets to see John Grant (twice), Tove Lo and Ladytron. And there&#8217;s some heavyweight nostalgia coming &#8211; with gigs by the Pet Shop Boys and Bauhaus.</p>
<p>What about you? What live music did you really enjoy in 2019?</p>
