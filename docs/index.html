            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>If you're using GitHub Workflows to automate bits of your development process (test runs, deployment, stuff like that) then you're almost certainly using GitHub Actions as well. Actions are pre-build chunks of functionality that you can use in your workflows and which save you having to write a load of code yourself. I've never, for example, written a workflow definition that doesn't use <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout">actions/checkout</a> to checkout the current repo on the container that is running that workflow. Part of my workflow definition will always look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>steps:
  - name: Check out code
    uses: actions/checkout@v3
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>Or, at least, it will look a lot like that. The bit that might change is that <code>v3</code> on the end there. That is, of course, the version of the action that I'm using. And that will change when the author of the action releases a new version. Well, strictly speaking, it will change when I notice that there's a new version and bother to update the workflow definition.</p>

<p>Recently, I noticed that two of the actions I use frequently (including the checkout action which I use <em>everywhere</em>) had updated their version numbers and I hadn't known about the change. It took a few hours of work to update the version numbers in all of my workflow definitions.</p>

<p>And life isn't supposed to be that much work.</p>

<p>But there's a solution. And I discovered it thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/1134qvp/github_actions_is_it_safe_to_use_master/">a discussion on Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>If you're doing much work on GitHub (particularly in the Javascript/Node) area, then you'll have met <a href="https://github.com/dependabot">Dependabot</a>. It's a bot that scans GitHub repos for dependencies that are out of date and then (and here's the really clever bit!) it generates pull requests that update the repo to use the updated versions.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don't have many projects on GitHub that use the technologies that Dependabot targets by default. The few I have are web sites that use frameworks I've cloned from elsewhere - so I get the occasional PR that updates <code>packages.json</code> and I just apply them and forget about it.</p>

<p>But it seems that Dependabot can do far more than that. You just need to configure it properly in your repo. And one of the things it can do is to scan for out of date actions being used in your workflow definitions. You just need a file called <code>dependabot.yml</code> in your <code>.github</code> directory and the contents should look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code># Set update schedule for GitHub Actions

version: 2
updates:

  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      # Check for updates to GitHub Actions every week
      interval: "weekly"
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>Dependabot will then check your actions versions once a week and create PRs for any that are out of date. I know it works, because I added this to all of my repos this morning and it promptly created half a dozen PRs for repos where I had updated the versions but hadn't pushed the changes to GitHub. When I pushed the existing changes, Dependabot checked its PR against the new code, realised the PR was no longer needed and closed the PR. Which was nice :-)</p>

<p>It you're using GitHub Workflows (and I can't really think of any reason why you wouldn't be) then I recommend adding this file to your repos. Of course, GitHub has <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-dependabot">documentation about this feature</a>.</p>

<p>Dependabot clearly has more uses than I thought it did. I'm going to have to investigate it further. I wonder if it can check CPAN dependencies.</p>

<p>Do you have any Dependabot tricks that I would find useful?</p>

<h2>
  
  
  An itch to scratch
</h2>

<p>So many web sites start out with an itch to scratch, and this one is no different. In this case, it was about wanting to stay more informed.</p>

<p>Each day, the <a href="https://bbc.co.uk/news/">BBC News web site</a> publishes a story that shows the front pages of all of the British newspapers. Although a lot of the British press isn't particularly trustworthy, I still think it's good to get an overview of what they're saying about the day's news. So finding and reading this story on the BBC site is one of my morning rituals.</p>

<p>But they don't make it easy to find the archive of those stories. So it's hard to read anything than the current day's front pages - and even that story tends to vanish from the BBC site by lunchtime. I decided I'd like a page that contains an archive to these stories.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Scraping the site
</h2>

<p>The BBC don't publish an API for their web site, so we need to resort to screen-scraping. That, of course makes the process inherently fragile but it seems to be the best we can do at this stage.</p>

<p>It wasn't hard to create a program that pulls what I want from the web site using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Web::Query">Web::Query</a> (my tool of choice for scraping web sites).</p>

<p>Of course, having scraped the data, we need to store it somewhere. I decided to store it in a JSON document and worry about displaying it later.</p>

<p>So here's the code I wrote:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Nothing too complex there. We look for all of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags in the page and ignore the ones that don't contain text starting with "The Papers:". We then extract the information we want (the text, the link and the date) and store that all in the JSON document.</p>

<p>At that point, I could run the code to create the JSON file. I then created the GitHub repository and turned on GitHub Pages for the repo. Once that was all working, I could browse to <a href="https://davorg.github.io/bbc_papers/papers.json">https://davorg.github.io/bbc_papers/papers.json</a> to see the JSON.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Doing it every day
</h2>

<p>We need to run this code every day. That's simple enough with GitHub Actions. We simply add a workflow definition file to the repo. The workflow looks like this:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight yaml"><code><span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Overnight processing</span>

        <span class="s">git config user.email 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com</span>
        <span class="s">git add docs/</span>
        <span class="s">if [ "$GIT_STATUS" != "" ]; then git commit -m "Overnight job"; fi</span>
        <span class="s">if [ "$GIT_STATUS" != "" ]; then git push; fi</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Again, this is all pretty much standard stuff. We run the workflow on a Ubuntu container. It's a three-phase process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install everything we need</li>
<li>Run the program to get the new data</li>
<li>Commit the new data file to the repo</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the workflow is triggered in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>It runs at 09:00 every morning</li>
<li>You can run it manually from the Actions tab in the repo (that's what the <code>workflow_dispatch</code> line does)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Displaying our wares
</h2>

<p>Having got a daily build of the data, we need to create a web page to display it. I'm not a web designer, so this is going to be necessarily basic. I threw together a simple page using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>

<p>The next step was to grab the <code>papers.json</code> document, parse it and then display it on the page. Now, I can wrangle Javascript pretty successfully most of the time. but I wanted to get this working as quickly as possible, so I asked ChatGPT for some help. It only took a few iterations for it to give me this code:<br>

<p>It didn't work first time. But that's because I'm an idiot and didn't tell ChatGPT the name of my JSON document or how to correctly identify the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element in the HTML. But once I'd corrected my errors it all worked perfectly.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Summing up
</h2>

<p>So that's how I spent yesterday's lunch break. I can now see an archive of the BBC's stories about each day'd front pages by just going to:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://davorg.github.io/bbc_papers/">https://davorg.github.io/bbc_papers/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, just after I'd written it, I (once again) had a look to see if someone else had created something similar and found the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/cpml2v678pxt">BBC's page</a> listing all of the stories. Ah well, I had fun putting my version together.</p>

<p>All of this code is available <a href="https://github.com/davorg/bbc_papers">on GitHub</a>.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>That's an screenshot of <a href="https://github.com/davorg/">my GitHub contributions</a> for the last year. Almost 50,000 commits is a ridiculous number for one person to make in a year. Obviously I had some help.</p>

<p>The explanation is in my previous article <a href="https://dev.to/davorg/github-actions-for-semi-static-web-sites-597g">GitHub Actions for semi-static web sites</a>. In that article I explained how I was using GitHub Actions to rebuild a number of web sites every few hours. It doesn't take very many of those web sites before you start getting into dozens of automated commits every day. And it is, of course, those automated commits that are artificially inflating my commit count.</p>

<p>This has been mildly worrying me over the last year. I decided that I needed to do something about it. I needed to find a way to separate my real commits from these automated ones.</p>

<p>The previous article includes a sample GitHub Workflow file that I was using to run these sites. And it's easy to see what's causing the problem. There's a step that commits the newly-generated site and that step includes the following:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>git config --global user.name 'Dave Cross'
git config --global user.email 'my email address'
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>That email address is associated with my GitHub account and, therefore, those commits are seen as being made by me.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I made the first step towards fixing this. I changed that configuration to this:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>git config --global user.name 'Automated Workflow'
git config --global user.email "${GITHUB_ACTOR}@users.noreply.github.com"
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>We're using a more descriptive name and an email address that GitHub generates for us based on the username of the user who is running the workflow. This is better (as it won't assign commits to me if someone were to fork my repo and run the workflow) but it's still using an email address which GitHub has assigned to me and, therefore, the automated commits are still associated with me.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had another dig into this problem and I have found the solution. The new version I use it this:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>git config user.name github-actions[bot]
git config user.email 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>It turns out that there is a special GitHub user account that can be used to commit to your repos. This user is specifically there to solve the exact problem that I wanted to solve. It's just not particularly well-documented (or, if it is, it's not in the documentation that I've been looking at!)</p>

<p>You might notice that I've also removed the <code>--global</code> setting from the commands. On reflection, it seemed pointless to make global changes on a Docker container that is going to cease to exist in a minute or so.</p>

<p>So that's what I now use on all of my workflows that regenerate web sites. It will mean that I make substantially fewer commits this year and I can no longer be accused of trying to game the system in order to artificially inflate my number of commits.</p>

<p>Oh, and as a bonus, the GitHub Actions Bot has its own Octocat avatar that now appears in the commits for my repos.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--te-jPozW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1p8uxysiucvdrqcf3p1f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--te-jPozW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1p8uxysiucvdrqcf3p1f.png" alt="GitHub commits" width="880" height="253"></a></p>

<p>It's possible, of course, that I'm the last person in the world to realise this. But, hopefully, sharing the information will be useful to someone out there.</p>

<hr />
<p><em>Write a Perl CPAN module for connecting to a ChatGPT server</em></p>
<p>To create a Perl CPAN module for connecting to a ChatGPT server, you will need to have Perl and the necessary dependencies installed on your system.</p>
<p>To begin, create a new directory for your module and create a file called &#8220;ChatGPT.pm&#8221; with the following content:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">package ChatGPT;

use strict;
use warnings;

use Net::WebSocket::Client;
use Net::WebSocket::Server;
use HTTP::Async;

sub new {
  my ($class, %params) = @_;
  my $self = {
    host =&gt; $params{host},
    port =&gt; $params{port},
  };

  bless $self, $class;

  return $self;
}

sub send_prompt {
  my ($self, $prompt) = @_;

  my $http = HTTP::Async-&gt;new;
  my $client = Net::WebSocket::Client-&gt;new(
    url =&gt; "ws://$self-&gt;{host}:$self-&gt;{port}"
  );

  $client-&gt;connect;
  $client-&gt;send_utf8($prompt);

  my $response = $client-&gt;recv;

  $client-&gt;disconnect;

  return $response;
}

1;</pre><p>To use this module in your Perl code, you can create a new ChatGPT object and call the <code>send_prompt</code> method like this:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">use ChatGPT;

my $chatgpt = ChatGPT-&gt;new(host =&gt; 'localhost', port =&gt; 8080);
my $response = $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('What is your name?');
print "Response: $response\n";</pre><p>This will send the text prompt &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; to the ChatGPT server running on localhost at port 8080, and print the response to the console.</p>
<p>Note: This is just a basic example of how you can create a Perl CPAN module for connecting to a ChatGPT server. There are many other features and considerations that you may want to add to your module, such as error handling and customization options.</p>
<p>To make your module available on CPAN, you will need to follow the guidelines for creating and distributing CPAN modules, which can be found in the Perl documentation and online resources.</p>
<p><em>Use Moose to create the class</em></p>
<p>To use Moose to create the <code>ChatGPT</code> class, you will need to have Moose installed on your system. You can install Moose by running the following command:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">cpanm Moose</pre><p>With Moose installed, you can modify the class like this:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">package ChatGPT;

use Moose;
use Net::WebSocket::Client;
use Net::WebSocket::Server;
use HTTP::Async;

has host =&gt; (
  is =&gt; 'ro',
  isa =&gt; 'Str',
  required =&gt; 1,
);

has port =&gt; (
  is =&gt; 'ro',
  isa =&gt; 'Int', required =&gt; 1,
);

sub send_prompt {
  my ($self, $prompt) = @_;

  my $http = HTTP::Async-&gt;new;
  my $client = Net::WebSocket::Client-&gt;new(
    url =&gt; "ws://$self-&gt;{host}:$self-&gt;{port}"
  );

  $client-&gt;connect; $client-&gt;send_utf8($prompt);
  my $response = $client-&gt;recv;
  $client-&gt;disconnect;

  return $response;
}

1;</pre><p>In this version of the class, the <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> attributes are defined using Moose&#8217;s <code>has</code> keyword. These attributes are required and must be specified when creating a new <code>ChatGPT</code> object. The <code>send_prompt</code> method is unchanged from the previous example.</p>
<p>To create a new <code>ChatGPT</code> object, you can use the <code>new</code> method provided by Moose like this:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">use ChatGPT;

my $chatgpt = ChatGPT-&gt;new(host =&gt; 'localhost', port =&gt; 8080);

my $response = $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('What is your name?');

print "Response: $response\n";</pre><p>This will create a new <code>ChatGPT</code> object with the specified <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> attributes, and send the text prompt &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; to the ChatGPT server running on localhost at port 8080. The response will be printed to the console.</p>
<p>Note: This is just one way to use Moose to create the <code>ChatGPT</code> class. There are many other features and customization options available in Moose that you may want to consider adding to your class, such as type constraints, default values, and methods.</p>
<p><em>Call the class WebService::ChatGPT</em></p>
<p>To rename the <code>ChatGPT</code> class to <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code>, you will need to update the package name at the top of the file and update the <code>use</code> statements to refer to the new package name.</p>
<p>Here is how you can update the <code>ChatGPT</code> class to use the new package name:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">package WebService::ChatGPT;

use Moose;
use Net::WebSocket::Client;
use Net::WebSocket::Server;

use HTTP::Async;

has host =&gt; (
  is =&gt; 'ro',
  isa =&gt; 'Str',
  required =&gt; 1,
);

has port =&gt; (
  is =&gt; 'ro',
  isa =&gt; 'Int',
  required =&gt; 1,
);

sub send_prompt {
  my ($self, $prompt) = @_;

  my $http = HTTP::Async-&gt;new;
  my $client = Net::WebSocket::Client-&gt;new(
    url =&gt; "ws://$self-&gt;{host}:$self-&gt;{port}"
  );

  $client-&gt;connect; $client-&gt;send_utf8($prompt);
  my $response = $client-&gt;recv;
  $client-&gt;disconnect;

  return $response;
}

1;</pre><p>With these changes, the class is now called <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> and can be used like this:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">use WebService::ChatGPT;

my $chatgpt = WebService::ChatGPT-&gt;new(host =&gt; 'localhost', port =&gt; 8080);

my $response = $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('What is your name?');
print "Response: $response\n";</pre><p>This will create a new <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> object with the specified <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> attributes, and send the text prompt &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; to the ChatGPT server running on localhost at port 8080. The response will be printed to the console.,/p&gt;</p>
<p>Note: This is just one way to rename the <code>ChatGPT</code> class to <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code>. You may also need to update any other references to the class name in your code and documentation, as well as update the module file name and directory structure to reflect the new package name.</p>
<p><em>Suggest some tests using the standard Perl testing framework</em></p>
<p>Here are some examples of tests that you could write for the <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> module using the standard Perl testing framework (Test::More):</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">use Test::More;
use WebService::ChatGPT;

# Test creating a new ChatGPT object
my $chatgpt = WebService::ChatGPT-&gt;new(host =&gt; 'localhost', port =&gt; 8080);
isa_ok($chatgpt, 'WebService::ChatGPT', 'Object is a ChatGPT');

# Test sending a prompt and receiving a response
my $response = $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('What is your name?');
is($response, 'My name is ChatGPT.', 'Response is correct');

# Test sending an invalid prompt
eval { $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('') };
like($@, qr/Invalid prompt/, 'Invalid prompt error is thrown');

done_testing();</pre><p>The first test uses the <code>isa_ok</code> function to check that the object created by the <code>new</code> method is an instance of the <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> class.</p>
<p>The second test uses the <code>is</code> function to compare the expected response to the actual response returned by the <code>send_prompt</code> method.</p>
<p>The third test uses the <code>eval</code> function to catch any exceptions thrown by the <code>send_prompt</code> method when an invalid prompt is provided, and the <code>like</code> function to check that the exception message matches the expected error message.</p>
<p>These tests can be run using the <code>prove</code> command:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">prove -l t/chatgpt.t</pre><p></p>

</div>



<p>In this version of the class, the <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> attributes are defined using Moose‚Äôs <code>has</code> keyword. These attributes are required and must be specified when creating a new <code>ChatGPT</code> object. The <code>send_prompt</code> method is unchanged from the previous example.</p>

<p>To create a new <code>ChatGPT</code> object, you can use the <code>new</code> method provided by Moose like this:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight perl"><code><span class="k">use</span> <span class="nv">ChatGPT</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">my</span> <span class="nv">$chatgpt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">ChatGPT</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="k">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">host</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">'</span><span class="s1">localhost</span><span class="p">',</span> <span class="s">port</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">8080</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">"</span><span class="s2">Response: </span><span class="si">$response</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="p">";</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This will create a new <code>ChatGPT</code> object with the specified <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> attributes, and send the text prompt ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù to the ChatGPT server running on localhost at port 8080. The response will be printed to the console.</p>

<p>Note: This is just one way to use Moose to create the <code>ChatGPT</code> class. There are many other features and customization options available in Moose that you may want to consider adding to your class, such as type constraints, default values, and methods.</p>

<p><em>Call the class WebService::ChatGPT</em></p>

<p>To rename the <code>ChatGPT</code> class to <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code>, you will need to update the package name at the top of the file and update the <code>use</code> statements to refer to the new package name.</p>

<p>Here is how you can update the <code>ChatGPT</code> class to use the new package name:<br>
</p>

<p>This will create a new <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> object with the specified <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> attributes, and send the text prompt ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù to the ChatGPT server running on localhost at port 8080. The response will be printed to the console.,/p&gt;</p>

<p>Note: This is just one way to rename the <code>ChatGPT</code> class to <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code>. You may also need to update any other references to the class name in your code and documentation, as well as update the module file name and directory structure to reflect the new package name.</p>

<p><em>Suggest some tests using the standard Perl testing framework</em></p>

<p>Here are some examples of tests that you could write for the <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> module using the standard Perl testing framework (Test::More):<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">

<span class="nv">done_testing</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>The first test uses the <code>isa_ok</code> function to check that the object created by the <code>new</code> method is an instance of the <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> class.</p>

<p>The second test uses the <code>is</code> function to compare the expected response to the actual response returned by the <code>send_prompt</code> method.</p>

<p>The third test uses the <code>eval</code> function to catch any exceptions thrown by the <code>send_prompt</code> method when an invalid prompt is provided, and the <code>like</code> function to check that the exception message matches the expected error message.</p>

<p>These tests can be run using the <code>prove</code> command:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>prove <span class="nt">-l</span> t/chatgpt.t

<p>I haven‚Äôt uploaded it to CPAN yet. Do you think I should?</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>I‚Äôve been building Docker containers again. And I think you‚Äôll find this one a little more useful than <a href="https://dev.to/davorg/building-a-perlanet-container-43cm">the Perlanet one</a> I wrote about a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>Several years ago I got into <a href="https://www.travis-ci.com/">Travis CI</a> and set up lots of <a href="https://github.com/davorg?tab=repositories">my GitHub repos</a> so they automatically ran the tests each time I committed to the repo. Later on, I also worked out how to tie those test runs into <a href="https://coveralls.io/">Coveralls.io</a> so I got pretty graphs of how my test coverage was looking. I gave <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/davorg/github-travisci-and-perl">a talk about what I had done</a>.</p>

<p>But two things changed.</p>

<p>Firstly, Travis CI got too popular and, eventually, removed their free service. And, secondly, <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> was introduced. Over the last few years, I‚Äôve set up many of my repos to use GitHub Actions for CI. But, basically because I‚Äôm lazy, I didn‚Äôt remove the Travis CI configuration from those repos.</p>

<p>But last week I decided the time was right to start work on that. And when I went to remove the .travis.yml I realised that something was missing from my GitHub Actions CI workflows ‚Äì they were running the unit tests, but they weren‚Äôt reporting on test coverage. So it was time to fix that.</p>

<p>I needed to reimplement the logic that connected Travis CI to Coveralls.io in a GitHub workflow. That actually turned out to be pretty simple. There‚Äôs a CPAN module called <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::Cover::Report::Coveralls">Devel::Cover::Report::Coveralls</a> which takes the output from Devel::Cover, converts it to the correct format and sends it to Coveralls.io. And, as a bonus, it has documentation showing how to implement that in a GitHub workflow.</p>

<p>So I hacked at my workflow definition file for one of my CPAN modules and within a few minutes I had it working.</p>

<p>Well, I say ‚Äúa few minutes‚Äù, but it took over thirteen minutes to run. It turns out that Devel::Cover::Report::Coveralls is a pretty heavyweight module and needs to install a lot of other modules in order to do its work.</p>

<p>At this point, you can probably guess where this is going. And you‚Äôd be right.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve created a Docker container that has Devel::Cover::Report::Coveralls already installed. And, obviously, it‚Äôs available for everyone to use from the Docker hub ‚Äì <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/davorg/perl-coveralls">davorg/perl-coveralls</a>.</p>

<p>A couple of small adjustments to my GitHub workflow and the coverage job is now running on my new container ‚Äì and takes 29 seconds instead of 13 minutes. So that‚Äôs a win.</p>

<p>The relevant section of my <a href="https://github.com/davorg/calendar-simple/blob/master/.github/workflows/perltest.yml">workflow file</a> is here:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: davorg/perl-coveralls:latest
    name: Test coverage
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install modules
        run: cpanm -n --installdeps .
      - name: Coverage
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: cover -test -report Coveralls
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>And it‚Äôs producing nice graphs on Coveralls.io like the one above.</p>

So here they are in chronological order.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39755096-mike-oldfield-at-royal-festival-hall-southbank-centre"><strong>Tubular Bells at the Royal Festival Hall</strong></a><br>This was a strange show for several reasons. Firstly, it was advertised as commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of <em>Tubular Bells</em>. But the album was released in 1973, so it was two years early (apparently it was the fiftieth anniversary of when Mike Oldfield started writing the piece). Secondly, Mike Oldfield wasn‚Äôt performing‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut you needed to examine the publicity very carefully to work that out. And thirdly, there was a troupe of acrobats that were pointlessly leaping around the stage while the musicians played. All in all, I thought this was slightly disappointing.</li><li><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/38968289-heaven-17-at-roundhouse"><strong>Heaven 17 at the Roundhouse</strong></a><br>Many of these shows were postponed from 2020. This was originally intended to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Human League album, <em>Travelogue</em>, but it ended but being the forty-first anniversary. But none of that mattered. This was Heaven 17 playing all of the first two Human League albums and it was absolutely wonderful. Apparently, they had invited Phil Oakey to take part, but he wasn‚Äôt interested. That‚Äôs Heaven 17 in the photo¬†above.</li><li><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39828850-lump-at-scala"><strong>LUMP at the Scala</strong></a><br>LUMP is Laura Marling playing with Tunng‚Äôs Mike Lindsay. I kinda assumed that their first album was going to be a one-off, but they produced a second album in 2020. This was the first gig I‚Äôd been to in a cramped venue like the Scala for a couple of years and it all got a bit too much for me. I really didn‚Äôt enjoy the atmosphere and left during the third or fourth song. I still love the album though and I hope to build up my tolerance for gig crowds over the coming¬†months.</li><li><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39773071-staves-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire"><strong>The Staves at Shepherd‚Äôs Bush Empire</strong></a><br>Actually, this was only two-thirds of the Staves. One of the sisters has had a baby recently and has decided to sit out tours for a couple of years. But the two remaining sisters still put on a great¬†show.</li><li><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39786793-laura-marling-at-roundhouse"><strong>Laura Marling at the Roundhouse</strong></a><br>Given how few gigs I saw last year, it‚Äôs surprising how repetitive they were. Here‚Äôs Laura Marling again (and the Roundhouse again!) Although she has yet to match the heights of the <em>Short Movie</em> tour, Laura Marling is always worth seeing and this show was no exception.</li><li><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39662320-heaven-17-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire"><strong>Heaven 17 at the Shepherd‚Äôs Bush</strong></a><br>More repetition. I think the two Heaven 17 gigs were originally supposed to be several months apart, but the vagaries of the Covid scheduling changes led to them being just two months apart. This one celebrated the fortieth (actually forty-first) anniversary of Heaven 17 starting and was a glorious journey through their back catalogue. Oh, and the support was Pete Wylie, so I can finally say I‚Äôve seen all three members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucial_Three">Crucial Three</a>¬†live.</li><li><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39709208-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-at-eventim-apollo"><strong>Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark at Hammersmith Apollo</strong></a><br>OMD are just one of those bands that I see live whenever I can. I‚Äôve now been seeing them for over forty years (since they supported Gary Numan in 1980). They have such a massive back catalogue that they can just play hit after hit for two hours. But this show was a bit different as they started by playing all of their 1981 album, <em>Architecture and Morality</em>. They were as good as I‚Äôve ever seen¬†them.</li></ul><p>And that was 2021. What will happen in 2022? Well, I have tickets for a dozen or so shows but who knows how many of them I‚Äôll actually see? I‚Äôve already had emails postponing the Wolf Alice and Peter Hook shows I was going to see this month. I guess I‚Äôll just have to wait and see how the rest of the year pans¬†out.</p><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2022/01/2021-in-gigs.html"><em>https://blog.dave.org.uk</em></a><em> on January 9,¬†2022.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7ab20766b20f" width="1" height="1" alt="">       </div><!-- panel-body -->

              <h2><a href="https://perlhacks.com/2020/12/replacing-cpan-rt/">Replacing CPAN RT</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>[<strong>Update:</strong> the CPAN Request Tracker was saved. It&#8217;s now run by a new team of volunteers and none of my suggestions below are required.]</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, we learned that the <a href="https://log.perl.org/2020/12/rtcpanorg-sunset.html">CPAN Request Tracker was closing down early next year</a>. I proposed <a href="https://perlhacks.com/2020/12/rt-action-plan-for-cpan-authors/">a plan that CPAN authors could follow</a> to ensure that their users can still find somewhere to report bugs in modules (and, perhaps more importantly, to see what bugs have already been reported in modules).</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s only part of the problem. In fact, it&#8217;s probably a minor part of the problem. If you&#8217;re an active CPAN author, then you probably already knew about the impending closure and had already made plans to deal with it. It&#8217;s likely that you had already moved your bug tracking to a new system. At the very least, you now know what the problem is and are considering the best way to deal with it before next March.</p>
<p>The far larger problem is the thousands of distributions that aren&#8217;t owned by active CPAN authors. What are we going to do about those?</p>
<p>How big is the problem? Well, the site <a href="https://cpan.rocks/">cpan.rocks</a> displays stats about CPAN. One of the panels on its front page shows a summary of the bugtracker information in CPAN distribution. You&#8217;ll see that 24,873 distributions (that&#8217;s 66% of them) have no bugtracker information included in their metadata. That&#8217;ll be for a number of reasons. Some of them will be distributions that haven&#8217;t been updated since alternative bugtrackers were supported by CPAN (originally, it was just assumed that everyone used the CPAN RT); some of them will be because the authors don&#8217;t know how to add the required metadata; and some of them (including most of my distributions) are missing it because the author just hasn&#8217;t got round to adding it yet. There will, of course, be many more reasons.</p>
<p>Some people will have read the recent news and will be galvanised into doing something about it (I fall firmly into that category) but others (and I&#8217;d suggest that it&#8217;s a large majority) either won&#8217;t hear about the change or won&#8217;t care about it. And why should they care? They were generous enough to donate some of their code to CPAN at some point. They don&#8217;t have any obligation at all to carry on maintaining it after they&#8217;ve lost interest in whatever project led to them writing that software.</p>
<p>Take, for example, <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Mail-Alias">Mail-Alias</a>. That was released by someone called Tom Zeltwanger twenty years ago. He released three versions over a period of two months and then stopped. Who knows why. When he last updated the module, the CPAN search engine didn&#8217;t support alternative bugtrackers, so he never considered adding one. And that meant that the CPAN page for his module linked to the default bugtracker set up for the distribution on the CPAN RT. In the last fifteen years, <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Mail-Alias">four bugs have been reported</a> against that module. But as Tom has moved on, nothing has been done about any of them. There are a lot of modules on CPAN in a similar situation.</p>
<p>But that leaves <a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> (the current CPAN search engine) with a problem. Where does it send people who want to report a bug against an inactive module?</p>
<p>You might think that it doesn&#8217;t matter. But I disagree. Maybe I think that Mail::Alias would be the perfect module for a project I&#8217;m working on. Even before I start using it, it&#8217;s useful to be able to browse any existing bugs to see how they might affect my use of the module. And if someone later comes along and wants to take over maintenance of the module, then it&#8217;s useful for them to see any bugs that have been raised during the hiatus when the module was unmaintained.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m a big fan of having a default bugtracker for CPAN modules &#8211; even for ones with inactive authors. Which leads us to the question of where should that be. And I have a suggestion.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Micheal Schwern and Olaf Alders set up <a href="https://github.com/gitpan">Gitpan</a>. It&#8217;s an organisation which has a Github repo for every distribution on CPAN. And those repos each have a commit for every release of those distributions. Here, for example, is <a href="https://github.com/gitpan/Mail-Alias">the repo for Mail-Alias</a> &#8211; and you can see the three commits for the three releases I mentioned above.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d like to suggest Gitpan as a suitable place to use as a default bugtracker for CPAN distributions. There are a couple of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks like the auto-population of the commits stopped a few years ago. We&#8217;d need to work out how that works and catch up on the recent uploads.</li>
<li>None of the repos has the issue tracker turned on. But I expect that can be done with a relatively simple program that uses the GitHub API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we also have the problem that some people object to using GitHub since it was taken over by Microsoft. But that&#8217;s fine, they can just point their bugtracker metadata to their preferred system.</p>
<p>The problem with the CPAN RT was that it needed too much maintenance &#8211; and the Perl NOC team is really overworked. Any self-hosted alternative seems likely to have the same problem eventually. So I&#8217;m all in favour of using a third-party alternative. And if you&#8217;re taking that route, then it makes sense (to me, at least) to use a third-party system that already has all (ok, most) of the repos set up.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t spoken to Schwern or Olaf about this, so I don&#8217;t know if there was some major problem that would stop this plan from working. But I think it&#8217;s worth looking at.</p>
