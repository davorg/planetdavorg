It was my first time ever at a Perl conference in North America and it&amp;#8217;s been over twenty years since I spoke at a conference on that continent (it was an OSCON in San Diego).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk about using GitHub Actions for Perl development (which you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_Qk31v17g"&gt;watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;) and a lightning &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIaZZqQOxC4"&gt;talk about my CPAN Dashboard project&lt;/a&gt; (which is run using GitHub Actions). I&amp;#8217;ve had a few more sales of &lt;a href="https://actions.davecross.co.uk/"&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt; in the weeks following the conference, so I guess I persuaded a few more people to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://davecross.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Subscribe&amp;quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"&gt;&lt;div class="preamble"&gt;&lt;p class="cta-caption"&gt;Thanks for reading One Thing at a Time!

In particular, Olaf Anders&amp;#8217; talk &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J_9WQ_haDs"&gt;Whither Perl&lt;/a&gt; struck a chord with me. It was a measured rumination on where Perl is currently and what the community should be thinking about in order to get themselves into a better place. It got me thinking about the community and my place in it. I don&amp;#8217;t have any conclusions yet, but there&amp;#8217;s certainly a blog post brewing that will, hopefully, be written sometime this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing at a time&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I called this newsletter &amp;#8220;One Thing at a Time&amp;#8221;, it was really a message to myself. I&amp;#8217;m far too good at thinking of business ideas, starting prototypes and never turning them into real income. I want to curb that instinct in myself and actually build something into a profitable business. I don&amp;#8217;t mind if I end up with two or three (maybe more) small but profitable businesses, but I know that will only happen if I work on one of them at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, here&amp;#8217;s a sample of the things that are in my head at the moment (I&amp;#8217;ve included links to some web sites that are very much works in progress - don&amp;#8217;t be surprised if some of them make little sense in their current form):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two t-shirt/clothing ideas that I think could really sell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sequel to the GitHub Actions book which would be about GitHub Pages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coffee-table book about the royal family&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More marketing for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://actions.davecross.co.uk/"&gt;GitHub Actions Essentials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Do people want webinars on the subject? Would they pay for them?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://perldiver.io/"&gt;tool for Continuous Integration&lt;/a&gt; of Perl projects (written using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://127people.com/"&gt;A web app for beginners to genealogy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://morethanco.de/"&gt;More Than Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (and associated consultancy) that I&amp;#8217;ve discussed here before&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://claphamtechpress.com/"&gt;micro-publishing house&lt;/a&gt; that helps technical people get their knowledge published as ebooks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more, but eight items is a long enough list to be getting on with. I need to prioritise these ideas and work on one of them at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what criteria do I use to prioritise them? Well, honestly, I think it&amp;#8217;s about making money. Which of them will people pay for? And speed. How quickly can I start making money from them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GitHub Pages book would be pretty simple to write. I have an outline already and could knock the book out in a few weeks. The Perl CI tool would be fun to work on, but I don&amp;#8217;t think there&amp;#8217;s much of a market for people to pay for it. The genealogy app is a bit more work to get it up and running and I&amp;#8217;m not entirely sure how I&amp;#8217;d monetise it. The royal family book would just be a lot of work. The publishing house is a nice little project - but it&amp;#8217;s very dependent on how popular the individual books are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;em&gt;More Than Code&lt;/em&gt;. And I have a lot of it written already. For those of you who weren&amp;#8217;t around when I last discussed it - it&amp;#8217;s basically a book that&amp;#8217;s a mentor for people in a software development career. It talks them through all the bits of their job that aren&amp;#8217;t actually writing code. So it covers stuff like being an efficient developer by knowing tools like your editor and your operating system better. There&amp;#8217;s also a section about various software design and development processes and, at the end, it verges into &amp;#8220;fluffier&amp;#8221; areas like building a personal brand and getting known in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t decided which of these projects I&amp;#8217;ll be concentrating on next. But I thought would be interesting to give you a bit of a peek into my head as I&amp;#8217;m making up my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Are there any projects there that you&amp;#8217;d like to see me take to completion? Which of them would you pay for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll let you know what I choose in my next newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://davecross.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Subscribe&amp;quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"&gt;&lt;div class="preamble"&gt;&lt;p class="cta-caption"&gt;Thanks for reading One Thing at a Time!

    <title>The Perl and Raku Conference, Toronto 2023</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perlhacks.com/2023/07/the-perl-and-raku-conference-toronto-2023/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>It‚Äôs been over twenty years since I spoke at a conference in North America. That was at OSCON in San Diego. I‚Äôve actually never spoken at a YAPC, TPC or TPRC in North America. I have the standard European concern about being seen to encourage the USA‚Äôs bad behaviour by actually visiting it, so when I saw this year‚Äôs TPRC was in Canada, I thought that gave me the perfect opportunity to put that right.</p>
<p>So I proposed a talk which was accepted.</p>
<p>It was also the first time I‚Äôd been to any kind of conference since before the pandemic. My last conference was in Riga in 2019.</p>
<p>Despite Air Transat‚Äôs determination to prevent it from happening, my girlfriend and I made it to Toronto a few days before the conference started. It was her birthday, so we spent Sunday and Monday relaxing and getting to know Downtown Toronto. On Monday afternoon, we moved to the conference hotel and prepared to geek out.</p>
<p>One of the first people I spoke to at the conference on Tuesday morning was fellow Londoner Mohammad Anwar. As is the law (I don‚Äôt make the rules!) I was mildly rebuking him about the ridiculous amount of work he puts into the Perl community. I told him the story of a senior member of the community who, about ten years ago, said to me: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why you still make so much effort, Dave. You have your White Camel, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù I swear I didn‚Äôt know that Mohammad was about to be awarded the 2022 White Camel ‚Äì but it gave me the opportunity to go up to him and say, ‚ÄúSee, you can stop making such an effort now!‚Äù I hope he doesn‚Äôt really stop; but he should really take things a bit easier.</p>
<p>The next three days were a happy blur of geekery. As always at these conferences, there were too many talks that I wanted to see and, inevitably, I still have to catch up on some of them on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F36Tdrcg1tI&amp;list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFwrDiojWd_lFUaOHlsUUEJa">YouTube</a> (thanks to the dedicated video team for getting making them available so quickly).</p>
<p>There are a number of talks that I‚Äôd like more people to see. I think it would be a great use of your time to watch these videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1H9yKf8BI0">No One is Immune to Abuse ‚Äì Sawyer X</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT0S-jfO1mE">Coming Soon ‚Äì Curtis Poe</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J_9WQ_haDs">Whither Perl? ‚Äì Olaf Anders</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkKuA0UMdEw">What‚Äôs New in Perl v5.38 ‚Äì Paul Evans</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2X_caTDcAI">Perl 7 Retrospective ‚Äì Sawyer X</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I gave two talks ‚Äì a lightning talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIaZZqQOxC4">CPAN Dashboard</a> and a longer talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_Qk31v17g">GitHub Actions for Perl Development</a>. After not giving a talk for four years, I felt a little rusty ‚Äì but I think they went ok.</p>
<p>And then, after a seemingly-fleeting three days, it was all over and we all returned to our own countries. There‚Äôs another <a href="https://perlkohacon.fi/">conference in Finland next month</a>. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm unable to be there ‚Äì and last week‚Äôs experience makes me regret that.</p>
<p>It was great to catch up with old friends and share our mutual interest in Perl. It was particularly great after four years without a conference to go to. I hope it‚Äôs not four years until I‚Äôm at another.</p>

My episode was published yesterday, so I can now tell you all about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://davecross.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Subscribe&amp;quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"&gt;&lt;div class="preamble"&gt;&lt;p class="cta-caption"&gt;Thanks for reading One Thing at a Time! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"&gt;&lt;input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email&amp;#8230;" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"&gt;&lt;div class="fake-input-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="fake-input"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="fake-button"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s an excellent example of serendipity. Gavin Henry is one of the presenters of &lt;a href="https://www.se-radio.net/"&gt;Software Engineering Radio&lt;/a&gt;. He was looking for someone to appear on the podcast to talk about GitHub Actions when one of my newsletters plugging GitHub Actions Essentials appeared in his inbox. We exchanged a few emails and then spent a very pleasant hour or so talking about GitHub Actions back in April. The back-end team at SE Radio then took our conversation and turned it into a real podcast which &lt;a href="https://www.se-radio.net/2023/06/se-radio-567-dave-cross-on-github-actions/"&gt;is now available for you to listen to&lt;/a&gt; wherever you get your podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re not really sure why you should care about GitHub Actions (and, more importantly, why you should &lt;a href="https://actions.davecross.co.uk/"&gt;buy a book&lt;/a&gt; about it) then I think our conversation does a good job of explaining what GitHub Actions is and how it can help you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other marketing efforts on the book continue to have a slow effect. I seem to be selling far more copies on LeanPub than on Amazon. I wonder if that&amp;#8217;s my geeky audience having a preference for not using Amazon if possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;ChatGPT and Copilot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of the world, I&amp;#8217;ve been experimenting with the new generation of Generative AI tools. Sometimes it feels like I&amp;#8217;ve handed over most of the management of my life to GPT4. I&amp;#8217;ve been using it to plan meals, exercise sessions and even sightseeing trips. It&amp;#8217;s been really impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as a geek, it&amp;#8217;s coding where these tools really stand out for me. Over the last few years, I&amp;#8217;ve become a reasonably competent Javascript programmer. But GPT4 has really increased my productivity. As an example, here&amp;#8217;s my &lt;a href="https://psc.perlhacks.com/"&gt;web page which links to the weekly status reports from the Perl Steering Council&lt;/a&gt;. The initial version built a static page each week when the new report was published. But now it loads the data from a JSON file and builds a table that can be sorted in various useful ways. None of that would have been beyond my Javascript abilities, but it would have taken me a few hours to get there. With a few carefully-chosen prompts, the new version was ready in about an hour. It wasn&amp;#8217;t all plain-sailing - GPT4 consistently hallucinated the wrong name for a Font Awesome icon - but it was far easier than doing it myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also been experimenting with &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/a&gt;. I had put off trying it for months because I thought (wrongly, as it happens) that it only supported a small number of languages - that didn&amp;#8217;t include Perl. But that&amp;#8217;s not the case. Its Perl support seems to be pretty good. Ovid wrote &lt;a href="https://ovid.github.io/articles/using-github-copilot-with-vim.html"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; which summarises his (positive) experience with Copilot and mine is very similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My &amp;#8220;aha!&amp;#8221; moment came when I decided to refactor some code and Copilot read my mind and produced the correct code without any prompts from me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was working on a web application that needed to switch between two display modes - one had basically no CSS and the other used CSS to make the output far prettier. The class had an attribute called &amp;#8220;pretty&amp;#8221; which determined which version to use. So the method that renders the output contains code like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $css = $self-&amp;gt;pretty ? $self-&amp;gt;pretty_css : $self-&amp;gt;standard_css;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that $css variable was then interpolated into the output HTML. I decided to put that logic into a new method called &amp;#8220;css()&amp;#8221;. I just typed &amp;#8220;sub css {&amp;#8220; and when I pressed the enter key, Copilot suggested a body for the method that was exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was sold. I&amp;#8217;m currently on the free trial, but once that&amp;#8217;s up it&amp;#8217;s going to be well worth the tenner or month it&amp;#8217;s going to cost me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AWS and AI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was at the AWS Summit in London yesterday. As you&amp;#8217;d guess, generative AI was a big topic there as well. AWS already has &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/ai-services/"&gt;a number of AI-based services&lt;/a&gt; and that number is only going to increase as time passes. They now have a Copilot competitor called &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-codewhisperer-the-ml-powered-coding-companion/"&gt;CodeWhisperer&lt;/a&gt; which might be worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always come away from AWS Summit enthused to get my stuff moved into the AWS cloud and this year was no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I started writing a series of blog posts called &lt;a href="https://dev.to/davorg/series/892"&gt;Into the Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, where I was going to explain how I moved one of my personal projects onto AWS. I never completed that project (real jobs got in the way) but I think the time is right to get back to it. And I think I&amp;#8217;ll have a good helper this time. I&amp;#8217;ve already had a conversation with ChatGPT about the project and we&amp;#8217;ve come up with a plan to complete the transition. I&amp;#8217;ll let you know how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hire me&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might be able to tell, I&amp;#8217;m having a lot of fun writing books, experimenting with new toys and working on my own projects. But the mortgage still needs to be paid, so I&amp;#8217;m in the market to take on a bit of work. If you or anyone you know can make use of my skills (Perl, Linux, web development, databases, GitHub Actions, and so on) then please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://davecross.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Subscribe&amp;quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"&gt;&lt;div class="preamble"&gt;&lt;p class="cta-caption"&gt;Thanks for reading One Thing at a Time!

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>[This post might sound like I‚Äôm angry at people making it hard to make progress on some things. That‚Äôs not the case at all. I realise completely that people have limited time and they get to choose how they spend it. If people are too busy elsewhere or have moved on to other projects then that‚Äôs just how it is and we need to deal with that the best we can.]</p>
<p>Back in December 2020, I <a href="https://dev.to/davorg/the-story-behind-a-new-module-2gkp">wrote a blog post</a> about how I wanted to fix a long-standing problem with <a href="https://dev.to/davorg/the-story-behind-a-new-module-2gkp">App::HTTPThis</a>. I‚Äôm happy to report that two and a half years later, the problem has been fixed.</p>
<p>To summarise my previous blog post:</p>
<ul>
<li>App::HTTPThis allows you to run a tiny web server that will serve the contents of a directory over HTTP. But, unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt support default pages like ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù.</li>
<li>App::HTTPThis uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::App::Directory">Plack::App::Directory</a> (which is part of the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack">Plack</a> distribution) to do the work ‚Äì so it‚Äôs that which actually doesn‚Äôt support ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù.</li>
<li>People suggested <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Middleware::DirIndex">Plack::Middleware::DirIndex</a>, but that also didn‚Äôt quite do the right thing.</li>
<li>I submitted <a href="https://github.com/plack/Plack/pull/654">a pull request on Plack::App::Directory</a> to add support for ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù.</li>
<li>I wrote a new module called <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::App::DirectoryIndex">Plack::App::DirectoryIndex</a> which was like Plack::App::Directory but with added support for ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù.</li>
<li>I submitted a pull request on App::HTTPThis to use my module in place of Plack::App::Directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now read on‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Both of my pull requests went unactioned for months. In the end, I decided to approach the Perl modules list to ask if I could get co-maintainer permission on App::HTTPThis (it looked like the original maintainer had lost interest ‚Äì there hadn‚Äôt been a release since 2010). When I heard nothing back, I put the project to one side only occasionally returning to add a new comment on my two pull requests.</p>
<p>Then last month I decided I‚Äôd have another go at getting co-maintainer permissions. This time it worked and, earlier this week, I got an email from Neil Bowers saying that the previous maintainer had agreed to give me permission and that I could now upload the module to CPAN.</p>
<p>At that point, I realised that the release mechanism for the module was based on Dist::Zilla and also that fashions in the Dist::Zilla world had changed since App::HTTPThis had last been released. This meant that many of the plugins used had been deprecated and I had to <a href="https://github.com/davorg/app-htttpthis/commit/9bdc04fcf80e3ec1c606867d0a6d56794506684b">do a bit of work</a> to even release the module (which led to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/13ib46n/distzilla_considered_annoying/">a small rant on Reddit</a>).</p>
<p>But I managed to release <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DAVECROSS/App-HTTPThis-0.003/view/lib/App/HTTPThis.pm">version 0.003</a> to CPAN. Only to realise very soon afterwards that my Dist::Zilla-wrangling had missed an important fix. <a href="https://github.com/davorg/app-htttpthis/commit/57e29f304e2aef1601f54886b25ec8a9bb0d05d6">I fixed that</a> and released version 0.004.</p>
<p>I then got an email from PAUSE telling me that I didn‚Äôt have permission to release the module. It seems this was <a href="https://github.com/andk/pause/issues/372#issuecomment-1548519281">a known PAUSE bug</a> and Neil was able to apply a workaround for me. I was able to release <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DAVECROSS/App-HTTPThis-0.004/view/lib/App/HTTPThis.pm">version 0.004</a>.</p>
<p class="">All of which means I now have a version of App::HTTPThis (and its included program, <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DAVECROSS/App-HTTPThis-0.004/view/bin/http_this">http_this</a>) which supports default pages. You just have to type, for example:</p>
<p/><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">$ http_this --autoindex .</pre><p>And the current directory will be served over HTTP. Also (and this is the important bit!) if you have a file called ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù then that will be used instead of the server displaying a directory listing. It‚Äôs a tiny improvement, but one that will be very useful to me. And well worth the two and a half years I‚Äôve invested in getting it released.</p>
<p>So why do I say that the mission is only ‚Äúalmost‚Äù completed? Well, there‚Äôs still that outstanding pull request on Plack::App::Directory. If that ever gets applied, I‚Äôll remove Plack::App::DirectoryIndex from App::HTTPThis (and mark it as deprecated on CPAN).</p>
<p>This is, of course, a supremely unimportant fix in the grand scheme of things. But I think it illustrates an important issue that the Perl community should be thinking about. The community is shrinking. Or, at least, the part of the community that supports CPAN modules and runs our important infrastructure is shrinking. CPAN is full of modules that are now unsupported. I‚Äôve lost count of the number of bugs I‚Äôve reported or patches I‚Äôve supplied that have been ignored because the module author is no longer interested. In some cases, I‚Äôve taken over the module myself, but that‚Äôs not a scalable solution. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know what it is. But I do think that relying on CPAN modules has got harder over the last few years. And it‚Äôs not going to get easier any time soon.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Seventy Years of¬†Change&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/650/0*4j8pPnverV8TTBnA.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her Majesty has, of course, seen changes in many areas of society in the seventy years of her reign. But here, we‚Äôre most interested in the line of succession. So we thought it would be interesting to look at &lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/1952-02-06"&gt;the line of succession on the day that she took the throne&lt;/a&gt; and see what had happened to the people who were at the top of the line of succession on that day. It‚Äôs &lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/"&gt;a very different list to¬†today‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/27d228-the-prince-charles-prince-of-wales"&gt;The Prince Charles, Duke of Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;We start with the one person who is in exactly the same place as he was seventy years ago. Prince Charles was three years old and hadn‚Äôt yet been made Prince of¬†Wales.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/b3fcb1-the-princess-anne-princess-royal"&gt;The Princess Anne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Princess Anne has fallen a long way in seventy years. The birth of younger brothers (back in the days when sex mattered in the line of succession) and those brothers having families of their own mean that she is now down at number¬†17.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/fbb68c-the-princess-margaret-countess-of-snowdon"&gt;Princess Margaret&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;We‚Äôve run out of the Queen‚Äôs descendants after only two places (today, they fill the top 24 places in the line) so we move to her sister. Princess Margaret had fallen to 11th place before her death in¬†2002.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/d7f62e-the-prince-henry-duke-of-gloucester"&gt;Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;We‚Äôve now run out of descendants of George VI, so we need to look at his brothers. This is the father of the current duke. He fell to 8th place before dying in¬†1974.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/8cb063-prince-william-of-gloucester"&gt;Prince William of Gloucester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Duke of Gloucester‚Äôs eldest son had fallen to position 9 before sadly dying before his father in¬†1972.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/48a2e0-prince-richard-the-duke-of-gloucester"&gt;Prince Richard of Gloucester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;As his eldest son predeceased their father, it was Prince Richard who became Duke of Gloucester when the first duke died in 1974. He is currently in 30th¬†place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/5a8417-prince-edward-duke-of-kent"&gt;Prince Edward, Duke of Kent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first Duke of Kent had died ten years earlier, so it was his son, Prince Edward, who held the title, at the age of 16, who was duke in 1952, He fell out of the top 30 in¬†2012.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/8c9114-prince-michael-of-kent"&gt;Prince Michael of Kent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prince Michael had fallen to 16th place before his marriage to a Catholic, in 1978, excluded him from the line of succession. He was reinstated in 2015 (because the Succession to the Crown Act meant that marriage to a Catholic was no longer a reason for exclusion) but he reappeared outside of the top¬†30.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/67541e-princess-alexandra-lady-ogilvy"&gt;Princess Alexandra of Kent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Princess Alexandra had dropped down the list pretty consistently throughout her life. From 1999 she popped in and out of the top 30 a few times. but she left it for the last time in¬†2003.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/1dc75a-the-princess-mary-princess-royal"&gt;Princess Mary, Princess Royal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The youngest child and only daughter of George V, Princess Mary had called to 17th in line before she died in¬†1965.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/1b0e5b-george-lascelles-the-7th-earl-of-harewood"&gt;George Lascelles, The 7th Earl of Harewood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fell out of the top 30 in 1994 before dying in¬†2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/c5f1e6-david-lascelles-the-8th-earl-of-harewood"&gt;David Lascelles, Viscount Lascelles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fell out of the top 30 in¬†1993.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/b20846-gerald-lascelles"&gt;Gerald Lascelles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fell out of the top 30 in 1982 and died in¬†1998.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/66315a-princess-arthur-of-connaught-duchess-of-fife"&gt;Princess Arthur of Connaught, Duchess of Fife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fell to 17th before dying in¬†1959&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/6b26f1-james-carnegie-3rd-duke-of-fife"&gt;James Carnegie, 3rd Duke of Fife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fell out of the top 30 in 1981 and died in¬†2015&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/2fede5-olaf-v-king-of-norway"&gt;Olaf V, King of Norway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;A bit of a leap as we find the royal family of Norway surprisingly close to the top of the list. King Olaf was a grandson of Edward VII (through Edward‚Äôs daughter Maud). He fell out of the top 30 in 1979 and died in¬†1991.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/5e0755-harald-v-king-of-norway"&gt;Prince Harald of Norway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prince Harald became king of Norway in 1991. He fell out of the top 30 of the British line of succession in¬†1977.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/d7a42c-princess-ragnhild-of-norway"&gt;Princess Ragnhild of Norway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Princess Ragnhild fell out of the top 30 in 1973 and died in¬†2012.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/1f2fa6-princess-astrid-of-norway"&gt;Princess Astrid of Norway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Princess Astrid fell out of the top 30 in¬†1964.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/eae275-carol-ii-of-romania"&gt;Carol II of Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next-closest royal family to ours is the Romanians. Carol II was a great-grandson of Victoria. The death of George VI moved him up a place from 21 to 20 and he remained there until his death the following year. Carol hadn‚Äôt actually been King of Romania since he was forced to abdicate in¬†1940.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/0e80c9-carol-lambrino"&gt;Carol Lambrino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question of Carol Lambino‚Äôs legitimacy is a question of some dispute‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso he may not have been on the line of succession at all. But, if he was, he fell out of the top 30 in 1963 and died in¬†2006.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/cf9743-paul-philippe-hohenzollern"&gt;Paul-Philippe Hohenzollern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;As son of the possibly-illegitimate Carol Lambino, Paul-Phillippe‚Äôs place in the line of succession is also in question. But, anyway, he fell out of the top 30 in¬†1962.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/128a10-prince-nicholas-of-romania"&gt;Prince Nicholas of Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prince Nicholas fell out of the top 30 in 1961 and died in¬†1978.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/289620-elisabeth-of-romania"&gt;Elisabeth of Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fell to number 27 before dying in¬†1956.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/b422b8-maria-of-yugoslavia"&gt;Maria of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fell to position 30 before dying in¬†1961.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/ef1b58-peter-ii-of-yugoslavia"&gt;Peter II of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter was no longer King of Yugoslavia, having been deposed in 1945. He fell out of the top 30 in 1961 and died in¬†1970.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/902052-prince-tomislav-of-yugoslavia"&gt;Prince Tomislav of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fell out of the top 30 in 1960 and died in¬†2000.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/96d8cb-prince-andrew-of-yugoslavia"&gt;Prince Andrew of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fell out of the top 30 in 1959 and died in¬†1990.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/92f66c-princess-ileana-of-romania"&gt;Princess Ileana of Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fell out of the top 30 in 1954 and died in¬†1991.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/p/7707ae-archduke-stefan-of-austria"&gt;Archduke Stefan of Austria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fell out of the top 30 in 1953 and died in¬†1998.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that‚Äôs an interesting list for a few¬†reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that we‚Äôve gone from two of the Queen‚Äôs descendants to twenty-four of them on the list (but even that‚Äôs not as big a difference as &lt;a href="https://blog.lineofsuccession.co.uk/2018/04/line-of-descendants/"&gt;happened during Victoria‚Äôs reign&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only ten of the people on the list are still¬†living.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There‚Äôs a large number of foreign royalty on the list‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbasically, the second half of the list is taken up by members of the royal families of Norway, Romania and Yugoslavia. This is obviously because of the way that royal families inter-married up until early in the 20th century. We see far less of that¬†now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what do you think? Was the 1952 list a surprise to you? Did you expect it to be as different as it is from the current¬†list?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.lineofsuccession.co.uk/2022/02/seventy-years-of-change/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;https://blog.lineofsuccession.co.uk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; on February 7,¬†2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c2bfe6c8f3a8" width="1" height="1" alt=""&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/line-of-succession/seventy-years-of-change-line-of-succession-blog-c2bfe6c8f3a8"&gt;Seventy Years of Change‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLine of Succession Blog&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/line-of-succession"&gt;Line of Succession&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The link will take you to a website which has links to all the places where you can buy it. Currently, that&amp;#8217;s Amazon and LeanPub, but I&amp;#8217;m open to suggestions of other places where you&amp;#8217;d expect to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, it&amp;#8217;s ebook-only, but I&amp;#8217;m looking into options for making it available in the physical world as well. Let me know if you&amp;#8217;d find that useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://davecross.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Subscribe&amp;quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"&gt;&lt;div class="preamble"&gt;&lt;p class="cta-caption"&gt;Thanks for reading One Thing at a Time!

But, in reality, the real work starts now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now need to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned before that I&amp;#8217;m not a natural marketer (is it &amp;#8220;marketer&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;marketeer&amp;#8221;?) I would love to live in a world where I mention my new book on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn and suddenly the sales start flooding in. But, sadly, it&amp;#8217;s not like that at all. There&amp;#8217;s a lot more work that needs to be done. I did the easy tweeting and stuff like that yesterday. This newsletter is the next step in the campaign. This is a relatively easy step. This feels a bit like talking to a group of friends. I hope you don&amp;#8217;t feel like you&amp;#8217;re being marketed to - even though you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buy my book! It&amp;#8217;s great!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#8217;s not how marketing is supposed to go these days. Hey, I&amp;#8217;ve read Seth Godin - I know how this stuff works. Let&amp;#8217;s try again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions will make your life easier by automating a lot of the software engineering process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GitHub Actions Essentials&lt;/em&gt; will show you how to use GitHub Actions in order to make your life easier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buy my book! It&amp;#8217;s great!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See! That&amp;#8217;s better, isn&amp;#8217;t it? My book solves problems and makes your life better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there are the bits of the process that a traditional publisher would do for me. Sending out review copies to people (and, later, chasing for reviews), paying for adverts in the right places (knowing where &amp;#8220;the right places&amp;#8221; are). I&amp;#8217;ll need to do all of that myself. (Hint - if you&amp;#8217;re able to help me get a review copy to someone who will write a relatively high-profile review, then please get in touch.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of things have serendipitously fallen into my lap. LeanPub has started doing a series of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmcABFZH2bU&amp;amp;list=PLUeW7hrYTk8yIkvPxCCBqO9I7k8nyPb3b"&gt;&amp;#8220;book launch videos&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; where they interview the authors of recently-published books. Overnight I got an invitation to take part in one of those - so I&amp;#8217;ll be interviewed next Monday for that. Also, when my last newsletter went out, one of the subscribers was looking for someone to be interviewed about GitHub Actions for their (pretty well-known) software engineering podcast. We&amp;#8217;re recording the conversation next week, so I&amp;#8217;ll be able to share more details in the next newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important marketing tip is to use any existing audience that you have. Some of you will know me from my work in the Perl community. The Perl community has annual conferences in both Europe and North America and I&amp;#8217;ve proposed a talk on &amp;#8220;GitHub Actions for Perl Development&amp;#8221; to both of them. Yesterday I heard that it had been accepted for the &lt;a href="https://tprc.to/tprc-2023-tor/"&gt;conference in Toronto&lt;/a&gt; in July, so it looks very much like I&amp;#8217;ll be speaking there. This will be the first time I&amp;#8217;ve spoken at a conference in North America since OSCON was in San Diego (over twenty years ago).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s possible that writing this newsletter is slowly turning into a marketing avoidance tactic. So I should probably stop now and turn my attention to some other potential customers. I&amp;#8217;ll be back with more updates in a week or two. Oh, but before I go, I wanted to include an extract for you (step 1: provide useful content). So, below is &amp;#8220;Appendix B: List of Useful GitHub Actions and Integrations&amp;#8221;. Hopefully, this will give you a brief flavour of the kinds of things that you can do with GitHub Actions (thereby giving you a reason to buy the book - this marketing lark is addictive!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speak to you soon,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Appendix B: List of Useful GitHub Actions and Integrations&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This appendix provides a curated list of useful GitHub Actions and integrations that can enhance your workflows and improve your development process. While this list is not exhaustive, it should help you discover the potential of GitHub Actions and encourage you to explore the GitHub Actions Marketplace for more actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;actions/checkout:&lt;/strong&gt; This action checks out your repository so your workflow can access its contents. It is one of the most commonly used actions in GitHub Actions workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repository:&lt;a href="https://github.com/actions/checkout"&gt; https://github.com/actions/checkout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;actions/setup-node:&lt;/strong&gt; Sets up a Node.js environment on the runner, allowing you to run Node.js scripts and tools in your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repository:&lt;a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-node"&gt; https://github.com/actions/setup-node&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;actions/setup-python:&lt;/strong&gt; Sets up a Python environment on the runner, allowing you to run Python scripts and tools in your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repository:&lt;a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python"&gt;

<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Douglas Adams ‚Äì The Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don‚Äôt still wear a digital watch, but I do like other things that are almost as unhip. In particular, I pine for the time about twenty years ago when web feeds looked like they were about to take over the world. Everyone had their favourite feed reader (I still miss Google Reader) and pretty much any useful web site would produce one or more web feeds that you could subscribe to and follow through your feed reader. For a few years, it was almost unthinkable to produce a web site without publishing a feed which included the changes to the site‚Äôs content.</p>
<p>Then, at some point, that changed. It wasn‚Äôt that web feeds vanished overnight. They still exist for many sites. But they are no longer ubiquitous. You can‚Äôt guarantee they‚Äôll exist for every site you‚Äôre interested in. I remember people saying that social media would replace them. I was never convinced by that argument but, interestingly, one of the first times I noticed them vanishing was when Twitter removed their web feed of a user‚Äôs posts. They wanted people to use their AP instead (so I wrote <a href="https://github.com/davorg/twitter-json2atom">twitter-json2atom</a> that turned their API‚Äôs JSON into an Atom feed ‚Äì I suspect it no longer works). Honestly, I think the main reason for the fall in popularity of web feeds was that people wanted you to read their content on their web sites where the interesting content was surrounded by uninteresting adverts.</p>
<p>But, as I said, not all web feeds vanished. There are still plenty of them out there (often, I expect because the sites‚Äô owners don‚Äôt realise they‚Äôre there or don‚Äôt know how to turn them off). And that means the web feed-driven technologies of the early 2000s can still be useful.</p>
<p>One such piece of technology is the feed aggregator. I remember these being very popular. You would create a web site and configure it with a list of web feeds that you were interested in. The site would be driven by a piece of software that every few hours would poll the web feeds in the configuration and use the information it found to create a) a web page made up of information from the feeds and b) another feed that contained all of the information from the source feeds. The most popular software for building these sites was called Planet Planet and was written in Python (it seems to have vanished sometime in the last twenty years, otherwise I would link to it). When I wrote a Perl version, I called it (for reasons I now regret) <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perlanet">Perlanet</a>.</p>
<p>I still use Perlanet to build planet sites. And they‚Äôre all listed at <a href="https://theplanetarium.org/">The Planetarium</a>. Recently, I‚Äôve started hosting all my planets on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> to rebuild the sites periodically. I thought that maybe other people might be old-skool like me and might want to build their own planets ‚Äì so in the rest of this post I‚Äôll explain how to do that, using <a href="https://perl.theplanetarium.org/">Planet Perl</a> as an example.</p>
<p>The first thing you‚Äôll need is a GitHub account and a repo to store the code for your planet. I‚Äôm going to assume you know how to set those up (in the interest of keeping this tutorial short). You only actually need two files to create a planet ‚Äì a config file and a template for the web site.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs part of the config for Planet Perl:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">title: Planet Perl

  name: Dave Cross

    web: https://perl.com/
  - feed: https://news.perlfoundation.org/atom.xml
    title: Perl Foundation News
    web: https://news.perlfoundation.org/</pre><p>I‚Äôve tried to make it self-explanatory. At the top, there are various config options for the output (the web page and the aggregated feed) and, below, are details of the feeds that you want to aggregate. Let‚Äôs look at the output options first.</p>
<ul>
<li>title and description: these are both strings that you can include on the web page that is created. They‚Äôre also used in the aggregate feed that is produced</li>
<li>url: this is where the web page will be available on the web</li>
<li>author: this contains details of the person publishing the aggregated site and feed. The Twitter handle is optional</li>
<li>entries: is the maximum number of entries that your output will contain in total</li>
<li>entries_per_feed: is the maximum number of entries that you will use from each of your feeds. This is to stop your output being swamped with entries from a particularly busy feed. This can be omitted, in which case there will be no limit</li>
<li>opml_file: OPML stands for ‚ÄúOutline Processor Markup File‚Äù. It used to be trendy to publish an OPML file which is a machine-readable data file which contains a list of the feeds that you are aggregating. These days, no-one cares. If you omit this setting, the file won‚Äôt be created.</li>
<li>page: this contains details of the web page you create. The template is the name of a template file that is used to create the HTML page (more on that below) and file is where the output page is written. If you keep the value used in my example, then things will work well with GitHub Pages as we‚Äôll see later</li>
<li>feed: this contains details of the aggregate feed we create. You can choose a format (Atom or RSS) and the filename. Again, the default filename will work well with GitHub Pages</li>
<li>google_ga: if this value exists, then it will be used as the Google Analytics identifier for the web page that is created</li>
<li>cutoff_duration: this is another way to control which entries are used in your output feed. Any entries that were published longer ago than this period of time will be ignored</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we have the section of the config file that defines the feeds that we are going to aggregate. Each feed has three data items:</p>
<ul>
<li>feed: the URL of the feed</li>
<li>title: a string to use to describe the feed</li>
<li>web: the URL of the feed‚Äôs original web page</li>
</ul>
<p>And that‚Äôs all you need for the config file. Create that, put it in a file called ‚Äúperlanetrc‚Äù and add it to your repo.</p>
<p>The other file you need is the template for the HTML page. This is usually called ‚Äúindex.tt‚Äù. <a href="https://github.com/davorg/planetperl/blob/master/index.tt">The one I use for Planet Perl</a> is rather complicated (there are all sorts of Javascript tricks in it). <a href="https://github.com/davorg/planetdavorg/blob/main/index.tt">The one I use for Planet Davorg</a> is far simpler ‚Äì and should work well with the config file above. I suggest going with that initially and editing it once you‚Äôve got everything else working.</p>
<p>I said those are the only two files you need. And that‚Äôs true. But the site you create will be rather ugly. My default web page uses <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for CSS, but you‚Äôll probably want to add your own CSS to tweak the way it looks ‚Äì along with, perhaps, some Javascript and some images. All of the files that you need to make your site work should be added to the /docs directory in your repo.</p>
<p>Having got to this stage, we can test your web site. Well, we‚Äôll need to install Perlanet first. There are two ways to do this. You can either install it from CPAN along with all of its (many) dependencies ‚Äì using ‚Äúcpan Perlanet‚Äù or there‚Äôs <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/davorg/perl-perlanet">a Docker image</a> that you can use. Either way, once you have the software installed, running it is as simple as running ‚Äúperlanet‚Äù. That will trundle along for a while and, when it has finished, you‚Äôll find new files called ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù and ‚Äúatom.xml‚Äù in the /docs directory. My favourite way to test the output locally is to use <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-HTTPThis">App::HTTPThis</a>. Having installed this program, you can just run ‚Äúhttp_this docs‚Äù from the repo‚Äôs main directory and then visit http://localhost:7007/index.html to see the site that was produced (or http://localhost:7007/atom.xml to see the feed.</p>
<p>You now have a system to build your new planet. You could run that on a server that‚Äôs connected to the internet and set up a cronjob to regenerate the file every few hours. And that‚Äôs how I used to run all of my planets. But, recently, I‚Äôve moved to running them on GitHub Pages instead. And that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll look at next.</p>
<p>There are two parts to this. We need to configure our repo to have a GitHub Pages site associated with it and we also need to configure GitHub Actions to rebuild the site every few hours. Let‚Äôs take those two in turn.</p>
<p>Turning on GitHub Pages is simple enough. Just go to the ‚ÄúPages‚Äù section in your repo‚Äôs settings. Choose ‚ÄúGitHub Actions‚Äù as the deployment source and tick the box marked ‚ÄúEnforce HTTPS‚Äù. Later on, you can look at setting up a custom domain for your site but, for now, let‚Äôs stick with the default URL which will be https://&lt;github_username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repo_name&gt;. Nothing will appear yet, as we need to set up GitHub Actions next.</p>
<p>Setting up a GitHub Action workflow is as simple as adding a YAML file to the /.github/workflows directory in your repo. You‚Äôll obviously have to create that directory first. Here‚Äôs the workflow definition for Planet Perl (it‚Äôs in a file called ‚Äúbuildsite.yml‚Äù, but that name isn‚Äôt important).</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">name: Generate web page

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2</pre><p>The first section of the file defines the events that will trigger this workflow. I have defined three triggers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pushing a commit. I could be cleverer here and only work when certain files are changed (for example, the config or the index.tt)</li>
<li>On a schedule. My example runs at 37 minutes past the hour every four hours (so at 04:37, 08:37, etc.)</li>
<li>Manually. The ‚Äúworkflow_dispatch‚Äù trigger adds a button to the repo‚Äôs ‚ÄúActions‚Äù page on GitHub allowing you to run the workflow manually, whenever you want</li>
</ol>
<p>Following that, we define the jobs that need to be run and the steps that make up those jobs. We have two jobs ‚Äì one that builds the new version of the site and one that deploys that new site to GitHub Pages. Remember how I mentioned earlier that there is a Perlanet container on the Docker Hub? Well, you‚Äôll see that the build job runs on that container. This is because pulling a container from the Docker Hub is faster than using a standard Ubuntu container and installing Perlanet.</p>
<p>The steps in these jobs should be pretty self-explanatory. Basically, we check out the repo, run ‚Äúperlanet‚Äù to build the site and then deploy the contents of the /docs directory to the GitHub Pages server.</p>
<p>Once you‚Äôve created this file and added it to your repo, you‚Äôll see details of this workflow on the ‚ÄúActions‚Äù tab in your repo. And whenever you push a change or when a scheduled run takes place (or you press the manual run button) you‚Äôll see logs for the run and (hopefully) your web site will update to contain the latest data.</p>
<p>I reckon you can get a new planet up and running in about half an hour. Oh, and if you label your repo with the topic ‚Äúperlanet‚Äù, then it will automatically be added to The Planetarium.</p>
<p>So, what are you waiting for? What planet would you like to build?</p>

&lt;p&gt;Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt still wear a digital watch, but I do like other things that are almost as unhip. In particular, I pine for the time about twenty years ago when web feeds looked like they were about to take over the world. Everyone had their favourite feed reader (I still miss Google Reader) and pretty much any useful web site would produce one or more web feeds that you could subscribe to and follow through your feed reader. For a few years, it was almost unthinkable to produce a web site without publishing a feed which included the changes to the site‚Äôs content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, at some point, that changed. It wasn‚Äôt that web feeds vanished overnight. They still exist for many sites. But they are no longer ubiquitous. You can‚Äôt guarantee they‚Äôll exist for every site you‚Äôre interested in. I remember people saying that social media would replace them. I was never convinced by that argument but, interestingly, one of the first times I noticed them vanishing was when Twitter removed their web feed of a user‚Äôs posts. They wanted people to use their AP instead (so I wrote &lt;a href="https://github.com/davorg/twitter-json2atom"&gt;twitter-json2atom&lt;/a&gt; that turned their API‚Äôs JSON into an Atom feed ‚Äì I suspect it no longer works). Honestly, I think the main reason for the fall in popularity of web feeds was that people wanted you to read their content on their web sites where the interesting content was surrounded by uninteresting adverts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as I said, not all web feeds vanished. There are still plenty of them out there (often, I expect because the sites‚Äô owners don‚Äôt realise they‚Äôre there or don‚Äôt know how to turn them off). And that means the web feed-driven technologies of the early 2000s can still be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such piece of technology is the feed aggregator. I remember these being very popular. You would create a web site and configure it with a list of web feeds that you were interested in. The site would be driven by a piece of software that every few hours would poll the web feeds in the configuration and use the information it found to create a) a web page made up of information from the feeds and b) another feed that contained all of the information from the source feeds. The most popular software for building these sites was called Planet Planet and was written in Python (it seems to have vanished sometime in the last twenty years, otherwise I would link to it). When I wrote a Perl version, I called it (for reasons I now regret) &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perlanet"&gt;Perlanet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still use Perlanet to build planet sites. And they‚Äôre all listed at &lt;a href="https://theplanetarium.org/"&gt;The Planetarium&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, I‚Äôve started hosting all my planets on &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; to rebuild the sites periodically. I thought that maybe other people might be old-skool like me and might want to build their own planets ‚Äì so in the rest of this post I‚Äôll explain how to do that, using &lt;a href="https://perl.theplanetarium.org/"&gt;Planet Perl&lt;/a&gt; as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you‚Äôll need is a GitHub account and a repo to store the code for your planet. I‚Äôm going to assume you know how to set those up (in the interest of keeping this tutorial short). You only actually need two files to create a planet ‚Äì a config file and a template for the web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs part of the config for Planet Perl:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;title: Planet Perl

  - feed: https://news.perlfoundation.org/atom.xml
    title: Perl Foundation News
    web: https://news.perlfoundation.org/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve tried to make it self-explanatory. At the top, there are various config options for the output (the web page and the aggregated feed) and, below, are details of the feeds that you want to aggregate. Let‚Äôs look at the output options first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;title and description: these are both strings that you can include on the web page that is created. They‚Äôre also used in the aggregate feed that is produced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;url: this is where the web page will be available on the web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;author: this contains details of the person publishing the aggregated site and feed. The Twitter handle is optional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;entries: is the maximum number of entries that your output will contain in total&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;entries_per_feed: is the maximum number of entries that you will use from each of your feeds. This is to stop your output being swamped with entries from a particularly busy feed. This can be omitted, in which case there will be no limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;opml_file: OPML stands for ‚ÄúOutline Processor Markup File‚Äù. It used to be trendy to publish an OPML file which is a machine-readable data file which contains a list of the feeds that you are aggregating. These days, no-one cares. If you omit this setting, the file won‚Äôt be created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;page: this contains details of the web page you create. The template is the name of a template file that is used to create the HTML page (more on that below) and file is where the output page is written. If you keep the value used in my example, then things will work well with GitHub Pages as we‚Äôll see later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feed: this contains details of the aggregate feed we create. You can choose a format (Atom or RSS) and the filename. Again, the default filename will work well with GitHub Pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;google_ga: if this value exists, then it will be used as the Google Analytics identifier for the web page that is created&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cutoff_duration: this is another way to control which entries are used in your output feed. Any entries that were published longer ago than this period of time will be ignored&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have the section of the config file that defines the feeds that we are going to aggregate. Each feed has three data items:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feed: the URL of the feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;title: a string to use to describe the feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;web: the URL of the feed‚Äôs original web page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that‚Äôs all you need for the config file. Create that, put it in a file called ‚Äúperlanetrc‚Äù and add it to your repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other file you need is the template for the HTML page. This is usually called ‚Äúindex.tt‚Äù. &lt;a href="https://github.com/davorg/planetperl/blob/master/index.tt"&gt;The one I use for Planet Perl&lt;/a&gt; is rather complicated (there are all sorts of Javascript tricks in it). &lt;a href="https://github.com/davorg/planetdavorg/blob/main/index.tt"&gt;The one I use for Planet Davorg&lt;/a&gt; is far simpler ‚Äì and should work well with the config file above. I suggest going with that initially and editing it once you‚Äôve got everything else working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said those are the only two files you need. And that‚Äôs true. But the site you create will be rather ugly. My default web page uses &lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; for CSS, but you‚Äôll probably want to add your own CSS to tweak the way it looks ‚Äì along with, perhaps, some Javascript and some images. All of the files that you need to make your site work should be added to the /docs directory in your repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having got to this stage, we can test your web site. Well, we‚Äôll need to install Perlanet first. There are two ways to do this. You can either install it from CPAN along with all of its (many) dependencies ‚Äì using ‚Äúcpan Perlanet‚Äù or there‚Äôs &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/davorg/perl-perlanet"&gt;a Docker image&lt;/a&gt; that you can use. Either way, once you have the software installed, running it is as simple as running ‚Äúperlanet‚Äù. That will trundle along for a while and, when it has finished, you‚Äôll find new files called ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù and ‚Äúatom.xml‚Äù in the /docs directory. My favourite way to test the output locally is to use &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-HTTPThis"&gt;App::HTTPThis&lt;/a&gt;. Having installed this program, you can just run ‚Äúhttp_this docs‚Äù from the repo‚Äôs main directory and then visit &lt;a href="http://localhost:7007/index.html"&gt;http://localhost:7007/index.html&lt;/a&gt; to see the site that was produced (or &lt;a href="http://localhost:7007/atom.xml"&gt;http://localhost:7007/atom.xml&lt;/a&gt; to see the feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now have a system to build your new planet. You could run that on a server that‚Äôs connected to the internet and set up a cronjob to regenerate the file every few hours. And that‚Äôs how I used to run all of my planets. But, recently, I‚Äôve moved to running them on GitHub Pages instead. And that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll look at next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to this. We need to configure our repo to have a GitHub Pages site associated with it and we also need to configure GitHub Actions to rebuild the site every few hours. Let‚Äôs take those two in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning on GitHub Pages is simple enough. Just go to the ‚ÄúPages‚Äù section in your repo‚Äôs settings. Choose ‚ÄúGitHub Actions‚Äù as the deployment source and tick the box marked ‚ÄúEnforce HTTPS‚Äù. Later on, you can look at setting up a custom domain for your site but, for now, let‚Äôs stick with the default URL which will be https://.github.io/. Nothing will appear yet, as we need to set up GitHub Actions next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up a GitHub Action workflow is as simple as adding a YAML file to the /.github/workflows directory in your repo. You‚Äôll obviously have to create that directory first. Here‚Äôs the workflow definition for Planet Perl (it‚Äôs in a file called ‚Äúbuildsite.yml‚Äù, but that name isn‚Äôt important).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;name: Generate web page

on:
  push:
    branches: '*'
  schedule:
    - cron: '37 */4 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: davorg/perl-perlanet:latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Create pages
      run: |
        mkdir -p docs
        perlanet &amp;gt; perlanet.log 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
    - name: Commit new page
      if: github.repository == 'davorg/planetperl'
      run: |
        git config --global --add safe.directory /__w/planetperl/planetperl
        GIT_STATUS=$(git status --porcelain)
        echo $GIT_STATUS
        git config user.name github-actions[bot]
        git config user.email 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
        git add docs/
        if ["$GIT_STATUS" != ""]; then git commit -m "Automated Web page generation"; fi
        if ["$GIT_STATUS" != ""]; then git push; fi
    - name: Archive perlanet logs
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: perlanet.log
        path: ./perlanet.log
        retention-days: 3

    - name: Update pages artifact
      uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1
      with:
        path: docs/

  deploy:
    needs: build
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first section of the file defines the events that will trigger this workflow. I have defined three triggers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing a commit. I could be cleverer here and only work when certain files are changed (for example, the config or the index.tt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a schedule. My example runs at 37 minutes past the hour every four hours (so at 04:37, 08:37, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manually. The ‚Äúworkflow_dispatch‚Äù trigger adds a button to the repo‚Äôs ‚ÄúActions‚Äù page on GitHub allowing you to run the workflow manually, whenever you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following that, we define the jobs that need to be run and the steps that make up those jobs. We have two jobs ‚Äì one that builds the new version of the site and one that deploys that new site to GitHub Pages. Remember how I mentioned earlier that there is a Perlanet container on the Docker Hub? Well, you‚Äôll see that the build job runs on that container. This is because pulling a container from the Docker Hub is faster than using a standard Ubuntu container and installing Perlanet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steps in these jobs should be pretty self-explanatory. Basically, we check out the repo, run ‚Äúperlanet‚Äù to build the site and then deploy the contents of the /docs directory to the GitHub Pages server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you‚Äôve created this file and added it to your repo, you‚Äôll see details of this workflow on the ‚ÄúActions‚Äù tab in your repo. And whenever you push a change or when a scheduled run takes place (or you press the manual run button) you‚Äôll see logs for the run and (hopefully) your web site will update to contain the latest data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reckon you can get a new planet up and running in about half an hour. Oh, and if you label your repo with the topic ‚Äúperlanet‚Äù, then it will automatically be added to The Planetarium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are you waiting for? What planet would you like to build?&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve been following &lt;a href="https://dev.to/davorg"&gt;my blog posts on dev.to&lt;/a&gt;, then you&amp;#8217;ll know that I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot of work with GitHub Actions over the last year or so. If you haven&amp;#8217;t seen what I&amp;#8217;ve been writing, here are a few links to catch you up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/davorg/github-actions-for-semi-static-web-sites-597g"&gt;GitHub Actions for semi-static web sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/davorg/not-that-pr-thanks-3m1c"&gt;Not that PR, thanks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/davorg/dependabot-and-github-actions-3lai"&gt;Dependabot and GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/davorg/deploying-github-pages-site-with-github-workflows-3bhh"&gt;Deploying GitHub Pages sites with GitHub Workflows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that GitHub Actions is a useful feature which allows you to automate large parts of the software development process. Every day that I use it, I find another interesting thing about it and I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ve only scratched the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://davecross.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Subscribe&amp;quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"&gt;&lt;div class="preamble"&gt;&lt;p class="cta-caption"&gt;Thanks for reading One Thing at a Time!

And it&amp;#8217;s almost ready to be published. The front cover is below and I&amp;#8217;ve been working on &lt;a href="https://actions.davecross.co.uk/"&gt;a website about the book&lt;/a&gt; (it&amp;#8217;s very much a work in progress - feel free to take a look but don&amp;#8217;t be surprised if things don&amp;#8217;t work and please don&amp;#8217;t share the link with anyone else yet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af1c655-f9dc-433d-8c9a-96086350efba_1410x2250.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af1c655-f9dc-433d-8c9a-96086350efba_1410x2250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af1c655-f9dc-433d-8c9a-96086350efba_1410x2250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af1c655-f9dc-433d-8c9a-96086350efba_1410x2250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af1c655-f9dc-433d-8c9a-96086350efba_1410x2250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af1c655-f9dc-433d-8c9a-96086350efba_1410x2250.png" width="246" height="392.5531914893617" data-attrs="{&amp;quot;src&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6af1c655-f9dc-433d-8c9a-96086350efba_1410x2250.png&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;srcNoWatermark&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;fullscreen&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;imageSize&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:2250,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:1410,&amp;quot;resizeWidth&amp;quot;:246,&amp;quot;bytes&amp;quot;:1382881,&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;image/png&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;belowTheFold&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;topImage&amp;quot;:true,&amp;quot;internalRedirect&amp;quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af1c655-f9dc-433d-8c9a-96086350efba_1410x2250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af1c655-f9dc-433d-8c9a-96086350efba_1410x2250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af1c655-f9dc-433d-8c9a-96086350efba_1410x2250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6af1c655-f9dc-433d-8c9a-96086350efba_1410x2250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;div class="image-link-expand"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"&gt;&lt;polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"&gt;&lt;/polyline&gt;&lt;polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"&gt;&lt;/polyline&gt;&lt;line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that the web page does have already is a table of contents - so you can see whether or not you&amp;#8217;ll be interested in the book. And, below, I present the first preview content from  the book. This is an extract from section 10.3 - &lt;em&gt;Automating Project Management and Collaboration&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Automating Project Management and Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automating project management and collaboration tasks can significantly improve the efficiency of your development process and help your team stay focused on delivering high-quality code. GitHub Actions provides a flexible platform for creating custom workflows to automate various aspects of your project management and collaboration efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this section, we will discuss several examples of how you can leverage GitHub Actions to automate project management and collaboration tasks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Automating Issue and Pull Request Management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues and pull requests are at the core of GitHub's collaborative features, allowing team members to report bugs, suggest enhancements, and submit code changes. By automating their management with GitHub Actions, you can save time, improve organization, and ensure consistency in your project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some key aspects of automating issue and pull request management with GitHub Actions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labelling:&lt;/strong&gt; Automatically apply labels to new issues and pull requests based on predefined criteria. For example, you can label issues as "bug" or "enhancement" based on their description or use specific labels for pull requests targeting particular branches. This helps categorize and prioritize tasks within your project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assignment:&lt;/strong&gt; Assign issues and pull requests to specific team members or groups based on predefined rules. This ensures that the right person is responsible for addressing each task and helps distribute workload evenly across your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triage:&lt;/strong&gt; Automatically move issues and pull requests through different stages of your development process. For example, you can create a workflow that automatically moves a pull request to a "review" stage when it's ready for review, and then to a "testing" stage when it's been approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notifications:&lt;/strong&gt; Send custom notifications to team members, Slack channels, or email addresses when specific events occur. This can help keep your team informed about the progress of issues and pull requests, and ensure that everyone is on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated checks:&lt;/strong&gt; Implement automated checks and validations for pull requests to ensure that they meet certain quality standards before they can be merged. For example, you can enforce that all pull requests pass your CI pipeline or meet specific code coverage thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merging:&lt;/strong&gt; Automate the process of merging pull requests once they meet certain criteria, such as passing all required checks or receiving a specific number of approvals. This can help streamline your development process and ensure that code changes are merged promptly and consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get started with automating issue and pull request management, explore the available GitHub Actions in the marketplace that are designed for these purposes. You can also create custom workflows tailored to your project's specific needs. By implementing automation in your issue and pull request management, you'll be able to focus more on the actual development work and maintain a more organized, efficient, and collaborative project environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Integrating GitHub Actions with Project Boards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub Project Boards provide a visual representation of your project's progress, allowing you to manage tasks, prioritize work, and track milestones. Integrating GitHub Actions with Project Boards can streamline your project management and help you maintain an up-to-date view of your project's status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some key aspects of integrating GitHub Actions with Project Boards:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic Card Creation:&lt;/strong&gt; Automatically create cards on your Project Board when new issues or pull requests are opened. This ensures that all tasks are tracked in a centralized location and allows team members to get an overview of the work that needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Card Movement:&lt;/strong&gt; Automate the movement of cards between different columns on your Project Board based on specific triggers or events. For example, when a pull request is approved, you can automatically move its corresponding card to a "Ready for Merge" column. This helps maintain an accurate representation of your project's progress and minimizes manual work for your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Card Assignment:&lt;/strong&gt; Assign cards to team members automatically based on predefined rules or conditions. This can help distribute the workload more evenly and ensure that the right person is responsible for each task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updating Card Details:&lt;/strong&gt; Automatically update card details, such as labels, assignees, or due dates, based on changes in the associated issue or pull request. This keeps your Project Board up-to-date and ensures that all relevant information is easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Board Notifications:&lt;/strong&gt; Send custom notifications to your team when specific events occur on your Project Board, such as when a card is moved to a different column or when a due date is approaching. This can help keep your team informed and ensure that everyone is aware of important updates or deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To integrate GitHub Actions with your Project Boards, you'll need to create custom workflows that interact with the GitHub API to perform actions related to Project Boards. Explore the available actions in the GitHub Actions Marketplace for managing Project Boards or create your own custom actions tailored to your project's needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By integrating GitHub Actions with your Project Boards, you can automate and streamline your project management processes, leading to increased efficiency and better collaboration among team members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Collaborating with External Teams and Services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many software projects, collaboration extends beyond your immediate team to include external teams or third-party services. Integrating GitHub Actions with these external resources can facilitate seamless collaboration, streamline communication, and ensure that all parties stay informed and in sync.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some key aspects of collaborating with external teams and services using GitHub Actions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interacting with External Repositories:&lt;/strong&gt; Set up workflows that interact with external repositories, such as creating pull requests, opening issues, or updating code in a forked repository. This can be particularly helpful when working with open-source projects or collaborating with other organizations on shared initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-Party Service Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate GitHub Actions with popular third-party services such as Jira, Trello, Slack, or Microsoft Teams to automate various project management, communication, and collaboration tasks. For example, you can create a workflow that posts a message to a specific Slack channel when a new pull request is opened or synchronize GitHub issues with Jira tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Workflows and Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; Share workflows and actions across multiple repositories or organizations. This allows you to establish best practices and maintain consistency across your projects. You can also leverage GitHub's reusable workflows feature to minimize duplication of effort and streamline the setup process for new projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access Control and Permissions:&lt;/strong&gt; Configure access controls and permissions for your GitHub Actions workflows to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions or access sensitive information. This is particularly important when working with external collaborators, as it helps maintain the security and integrity of your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration on Custom Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; Encourage collaboration on the development of custom GitHub Actions by making the source code available in a public repository. This allows external contributors to submit improvements, report issues, or suggest new features, fostering a community-driven approach to action development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To successfully collaborate with external teams and services using GitHub Actions, it's essential to plan and implement appropriate workflows, access controls, and integrations. This will enable your team to work efficiently with external collaborators, harness the power of third-party services, and maintain the security and integrity of your projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Automating Code Review and Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automating code review and feedback processes using GitHub Actions can significantly improve the overall quality of your codebase and streamline collaboration among team members. By incorporating automated checks and reviews, you can ensure that your project adheres to established coding standards and best practices while minimizing human errors and oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some key aspects of automating code review and feedback using GitHub Actions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linting and Static Code Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate linters and static code analysis tools in your workflows to automatically check for syntax errors, code style violations, and other issues. These tools can provide immediate feedback on pull requests, ensuring that your codebase remains clean and maintainable. Popular tools include ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python, and RuboCop for Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Testing:&lt;/strong&gt; Configure your workflows to run automated tests on every pull request or commit. This helps identify potential issues early in the development process and ensures that new changes do not introduce regressions. You can also use GitHub Actions to run tests in parallel or across multiple environments, further increasing the reliability and robustness of your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Review Automation:&lt;/strong&gt; Use GitHub Actions to automate various aspects of the code review process, such as automatically assigning reviewers, enforcing review policies, or checking for compliance with specific guidelines. This can help streamline the review process and ensure that all code changes are thoroughly vetted before being merged into the main branch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Feedback:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate GitHub Actions with communication platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams to provide real-time feedback on code changes. For example, you can create a workflow that sends a message to a specific channel whenever a new pull request is opened or when automated tests fail. This helps keep your team informed and encourages prompt action on issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance and Security Checks:&lt;/strong&gt; Use GitHub Actions to automatically analyze your code for performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and other potential issues. Tools like SonarQube or Snyk can help you identify and address these concerns early in the development process, ensuring that your code remains secure and performant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;By automating code review and feedback processes using GitHub Actions, you can establish a more efficient and effective collaboration environment for your team. This, in turn, leads to higher quality code, fewer defects, and faster development cycles, ultimately resulting in a more successful and robust software project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Streamlining Documentation and Knowledge Management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective documentation and knowledge management are critical to the success of any software project. They ensure that all team members have access to the information they need to understand, contribute to, and maintain the codebase. GitHub Actions can help automate and streamline various aspects of documentation and knowledge management, making it easier for your team to stay informed and up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some key strategies for streamlining documentation and knowledge management using GitHub Actions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Documentation Generation:&lt;/strong&gt; Use GitHub Actions to automatically generate and update project documentation based on code comments, markdown files, or other sources. Tools like JSDoc, Sphinx, and Jekyll can help you create comprehensive and well-structured documentation with minimal effort. By integrating these tools into your workflow, you can ensure that your documentation remains current and accurate as your codebase evolves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation Linting and Validation:&lt;/strong&gt; Validate your documentation for syntax, structure, and consistency using GitHub Actions. Tools like markdownlint, textlint, or reStructuredText linters can help you enforce documentation standards and best practices. By automatically checking documentation in pull requests or commits, you can maintain high-quality documentation that is easy to understand and navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Knowledge Base Updates:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate GitHub Actions with your knowledge management system or wiki to automatically update documentation and other resources when changes are made to your codebase. For example, you could create a workflow that updates a Confluence page or a GitHub Wiki whenever a new feature is added or an existing feature is modified. This ensures that your team always has access to the most up-to-date information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change Tracking and Notification:&lt;/strong&gt; Use GitHub Actions to monitor changes to documentation and other knowledge resources, and notify team members of relevant updates. This can help keep your team informed about important changes and encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing. Integrating GitHub Actions with communication platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams can facilitate real-time notifications and discussions around documentation updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating Release Notes:&lt;/strong&gt; Generate and publish release notes automatically using GitHub Actions. By extracting relevant information from commit messages, pull requests, and issue tracker updates, you can create detailed and accurate release notes that help users understand the changes and improvements in each new version of your software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;By leveraging GitHub Actions to automate and streamline documentation and knowledge management processes, you can foster a more informed and collaborative development environment. This leads to better decision-making, more efficient workflows, and ultimately, a more successful and maintainable software project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need your help with the book. I think the book is in pretty good shape, but I&amp;#8217;m looking for a handful of people to give it a read and let me know what you think about it. I&amp;#8217;m really looking for help in three areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the subject matter interesting or useful? And do I go into enough detail (or, perhaps, too much)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the content accurate? Or have I made a bit of a fool of myself in some places?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How&amp;#8217;s my English? I like to think that I know how to write reasonably well, but with something this substantial, there are always going to be a few errors that will creep in. Let&amp;#8217;s get those knocked on the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m afraid, the timescales are pretty tight. I&amp;#8217;d like to get this published towards the end of next week. So please only volunteer if you&amp;#8217;ll have time to spend on the project over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In exchange, you&amp;#8217;ll get a credit in the foreword and a copy of the ebook in whatever format you prefer (as long as that&amp;#8217;s EPUB, Mobi or PDF!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please get in touch by email or on Twitter or Mastodon if you&amp;#8217;d like to help. I&amp;#8217;ll send a link to the first half a dozen or so to get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, hopefully, I&amp;#8217;ll have more news about this next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://davecross.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Subscribe&amp;quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"&gt;&lt;div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"&gt;&lt;div class="preamble"&gt;&lt;p class="cta-caption"&gt;Thanks for reading One Thing at a Time!

    <title>Deploying GitHub Pages sites with GitHub Workflows</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/davorg/deploying-github-pages-site-with-github-workflows-3bhh" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I've written before about <a href="https://dev.to/davorg/github-actions-for-semi-static-web-sites-597g">how I use GitHub Workflows to keep "semi-static" web sites up to date</a>. It's a technique that I've found really useful. When I wrote that blog post, things were pretty simple - you chose which branch held your web site (there was a tradition for a while to use <code>gh-pages</code>) and whether the web site pages were in the repos root directory or the directory called <code>/docs</code>. I usually put my web site files into the <code>/docs</code> directory in the <code>master</code> (now <code>main</code>) branch and things worked just fine.</p>

<p>The reason for storing the site in <code>/docs</code> was so that there was a separation between the files that were used to generate the site from the generated output site itself. Many of my repos would have a <code>/tt</code> directory that contained templates, a <code>/data</code> directory which contains JSON files or an SQLite database and a <code>/bin</code> directory with a <code>build</code> program that pulls all that stuff together and generates a pile of HTML files that end up in the <code>/docs</code> directory. In my original blog post on this subject, I demonstrated a GitHub Workflow definition that would regenerate the site (when input files changed or on a schedule) and committed any changed files in the <code>/docs</code> directory. Some GitHub magic would then ensure that the new version of the site was deployed to the GitHub Pages server. All was well with the world.</p>

<p>Then, a few months ago, things got a little more complicated. We gained options about how your GitHub Pages site was deployed. The standard version that I'd be using before was called "deploy from a branch" but there was another option called "GitHub Actions". It seemed likely to me that I really needed to start using the "GitHub Actions" option, but things were still working the old way, and I had far more interesting things to investigate, so I left things the way they were.</p>

<p>Well, I say things were still working in the old way... They were, but something was a bit different. It seemed that the old method was being powered by a new GitHub Workflow called "pages-build-deployment" that had been automatically added to all the repos that needed it. And looking into the details of that workflow, I noticed that it was doing some things that were unnecessary in my repos - for example it assumed that the site was being built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and that was only true for a couple of my repos. For most of them, that was unnecessary work. So I needed to look into the new deployment option in more detail.</p>

<p>I started a couple of weeks ago, by simply switching the option from "deploy from a branch" to "GitHub Actions" in the hope that, because I was already using GitHub Actions, things would Just Work. But, unfortunately, that wasn't the case. My new site was being generated and committed to the repo - but the changes weren't showing up on the live site. So I switched things back until I had time to look into in it more detail.</p>

<p>That time was today. It seemed that I needed to include code in my GitHub Workflow that would actually handle the deployment of the site to the GitHub Pages servers. A quick search of the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">GitHub Actions marketplace</a> found the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-github-pages-site">Deploy GitHub Pages site</a> action which seemed to be the right thing. But reading the documentation, I worked out that it wanted to deploy the site from an artifact, so I needed to create that first. And then I found <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-github-pages-artifact">Upload GitHub Pages artifact</a> which did the right thing. So it was just a case of adding these two actions to my workflows in the correct way.</p>

<p>Previously, my workflows for these sites just needed a single job (called <code>build</code>) but now I added a <code>deploy</code> job which depended on <code>build</code>. For example, the workflow that builds <a href="https://perl.theplanetarium.org/">Planet Perl</a> now looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>name: Generate web page

on:
  push:
    branches: '*'
  schedule:
    - cron: '37 */4 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: davorg/perl-perlanet:latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Create pages
      run: |
        mkdir -p docs
        perlanet &gt; perlanet.log 2&gt;&amp;1
    - name: Commit new page
      if: github.repository == 'davorg/planetperl'
      run: |
        git config --global --add safe.directory /__w/planetperl/planetperl
        GIT_STATUS=$(git status --porcelain)
        echo $GIT_STATUS
        git config user.name github-actions[bot]
        git config user.email 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
        git add docs/
        if [ "$GIT_STATUS" != "" ]; then git commit -m "Automated Web page generation"; fi
        if [ "$GIT_STATUS" != "" ]; then git push; fi
    - name: Archive perlanet logs
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: perlanet.log
        path: ./perlanet.log
        retention-days: 3

    - name: Update pages artifact
      uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1
      with:
        path: docs/

  deploy:
    needs: build
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${\{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      id: deployment
      uses: actions/deploy-pages@v1
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>The bits that I've added are the final step in the <code>build</code> job ("Update pages artifact") and the new <code>deploy</code> job. All of the code is largely copied from the documentation of the two actions I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Having made this changes to one of my planet sites, I switched the deployment method and forced the workflow to run. And was very happy to see it ran successfully and the new version of the site appeared at the live URL as soon as the deployment had changed.</p>

<p>This makes me happy as I feel I'm using the GitHub Pages deployment the way that they're supposed to be used. I've updated all of my <a href="https://theplanetarium.org/">planet sites</a> to use this method, but I have several other sites that I'll need to get round to switching at some point.</p>

<p>As always when I find out something new about a GitHub feature, it leaves me with a couple of other suggestions for improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's possible to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows">call one workflow from another</a>. The planet workflows are all very similar. I wonder if I can define a single workflow that does all of the work and just call that from the individual workflow definition - passing in parameters to handle the differences.</li>
<li>Now I'm deploying the sites from artifacts, there is no need for the generated site to actually exist in the repo. That might well make a few things quite a bit easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, I thought I'd share what I had discovered today. Is anyone else generating web sites this way? How do you do it?</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This is a story of one of those nice incidents where something starts off simple, then spirals out of control for a while but, in the end, everyone wins.</p>
<p>On Reddit, a few days ago, someone asked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/119hu00/perl_rss_feeds/">‚ÄòIs there a ‚ÄúPlanet Perl‚Äù with an RSS feed?‚Äô</a> and a few people replied, pointing out the existence of Planet Perl (which is the first Google result for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=planet+perl">‚ÄúPlanet Perl‚Äù</a>). I‚Äôm obviously not marketing that site very well as every time I mention it, I get people (pleasantly) surprised that it exists.</p>
<p>On this occasion, it was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rwp0/">Elvin Aslanov</a> who seemed to discover my site for the first time. And, very soon afterwards, he started sending <a href="https://github.com/davorg/planetperl/pulls">pull requests</a> to add feeds to the site. As a result, we now have three more feeds that are being pulled into the site.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/tag/perl">Perl on Medium</a>. I‚Äôm slightly embarrassed that I hadn‚Äôt thought of this myself. I did, after all, once try to start <a href="https://medium.com/cultured-perl">a Perl publication on Medium</a>. I think I must have decided that there are better sites for technical blogging and blanked it from consideration. Medium‚Äôs not the busiest of places for Perl bloggers, but there are a few posts there and they‚Äôre mostly from people who are outside of the echo chamber ‚Äì so getting more eyes on their posts is a good idea.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag/perl">Perl questions on Stack Overflow</a>. Another one that would have been obvious if I had thought for a second. I‚Äôve been answering questions on SO for years. It‚Äôs a good way to get more perspective on how Perl is being used across the industry. Unfortunately, the feed only includes the titles of the posts ‚Äì you‚Äôll need to click the link to actually see the question.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/commits/blead.atom">Perl commits on GitHub</a>. I‚Äôm interested in hearing how useful people think this is. I worry slightly that there will be times when the number of commits will overwhelm the other feeds. But maybe that‚Äôs a good idea. Perhaps it‚Äôs good for more people to see just how busy the Perl 5 Porters are. I‚Äôm a bit annoyed that the feed puts everything in a fixed-width font, but not (yet) annoyed enough to do anything about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might know that Planet Perl is driven by <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perlanet">Perlanet</a>. So adding new feeds is just a case of adding a few lines to <a href="https://github.com/davorg/planetperl/blob/master/perlanetrc">a configuration file</a>. And looking at the pull requests I got from Elvin, showed a potential problem in the way the configuration was laid out. Each feed has three lines of YAML configuration. There‚Äôs a title for the feed, a URL for a web page that displays the content of the feed and the URL for the feed itself. They‚Äôre called ‚Äútitle‚Äù, ‚Äúweb‚Äù and ‚Äúurl‚Äù. And it‚Äôs that last name that‚Äôs slightly problematic ‚Äì it‚Äôs just not clear enough. Elvin got ‚Äúweb‚Äù and ‚Äúurl‚Äù muddled up in one of his PRs and, when I pointed that out to him, he suggested that renaming ‚Äúurl‚Äù to ‚Äúfeed‚Äù would make things much clearer.</p>
<p>I agreed, and the next day I hacked away for a while before releasing <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DAVECROSS/Perlanet-v3.0.0/view/lib/Perlanet.pm">version 3.0.0 of Perlanet</a>. In this version, the ‚Äúurl‚Äù key is renamed to ‚Äúfeed‚Äù. It still accepts the old name (so older config files will still work) but you‚Äôll get a warning if you try to use a config name in the old config.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt stop there. Last year, I wrote <a href="https://perlhacks.com/2022/10/building-a-perlanet-container/">a blog post about producing a docker image that already had Perlanet installed</a> ‚Äì so that it was quicker to rebuild my various planets every few hours. Since then I‚Äôve been rebuilding <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/davorg/perl-perlanet/general">that image</a> every time I updated Perlanet. But it‚Äôs been rather a manual process. And because I‚Äôm old and decrepit, I can never remember the steps I go through to rebuild it, tag it correctly and push it to the Docker Hub. This means it always takes far longer than it‚Äôs supposed to. So this time, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/davorg/perl-perlanet-docker/blob/main/build">a script to do that for me</a>. And because I now have the kind of mind set that sees GitHub Workflows everywhere I look, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/davorg/perl-perlanet-docker/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish_image.yml">a Workflow definition that builds and publishes the image</a> any time the Dockerfile changes. I guess the next step will be to write an action that automatically updates the Dockerfile (thereby triggering the rebuild) each time I release a new version of Perlanet.</p>
<p>But that‚Äôs a problem for another day. For now, I‚Äôm happy with the improvements I‚Äôve made to Planet Perl, Perlanet and the Perlanet Docker infrastructure.</p>

    <title>2022 in Gigs</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2023/02/2022-in-gigs.html" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Rather later than usual (again!) here is my review of the best ten gigs I saw in 2022. For the first time since 2019, I did actually see more than ten gigs in 2022 although my total of sixteen falls well short of my pre-pandemic years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are my ten favourite gigs of the year. As always, they&amp;#8217;re in chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39759069-pale-waves-at-roundhouse"&gt;Pale Waves at the Roundhouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve seen Pale Waves a few times now and I think they&amp;#8217;ve firmly established their place on my &amp;#8220;see them whenever they tour near me&amp;#8221; list. This show was every bit as good as I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen them.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39529194-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-at-royal-albert-hall"&gt;Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark at the Royal Albert Hall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another band I see whenever I can. This was a slightly different set where the first half was called &amp;#8220;Atmospheric&amp;#8221; and concentrated on some deeper cuts from their back catalogue and the second half included all the hits.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39529194-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-at-royal-albert-hall"&gt;Chvrches at Brixton Academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2020, I moved to a flat that&amp;#8217;s about fifteen minutes&amp;#8217; walk from Brixton Academy. But I had to wait about eighteen months in order to take advantage of that fact. The last couple of times I&amp;#8217;ve seen Chvrches were at Alexandra Palace, so it was nice to see them at a smaller venue again. This show featured a not-entirely unexpected guest appearance from Robert Smith.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/40060742-sunflower-bean-at-electric-ballroom"&gt;Sunflower Bean at Electric Ballroom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another act who I see live as often as I can. And this was a great venue to see them in.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39584368-pet-shop-boys-at-o2"&gt;Pet Shop Boys at the O2 Arena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#8217;s always one show a year that draws me to the soulless barn that is the O2 Arena. Every time I go there, I vow it&amp;#8217;ll be the last time &amp;#8211; but something always pulls me back. This year it was the chance to see a band I loved in the 80s and have never seen live. This was a fabulous greatest hits show that had been postponed from 2020.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39894954-lorde-at-roundhouse"&gt;Lorde at the Roundhouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new Lorde album means another Lorde tour. And, like Chvrches, she swapped the huge expanse of Alexandra Palace for multiple nights at a smaller venue. This was a very theatrical show that matched the vibe of the &lt;em&gt;Solar Power&lt;/em&gt; album really well.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/40274226-lcd-soundsystem-at-o2-academy-brixton"&gt;LCD Soundsystem at Brixton Academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another show at Brixton Academy. For some reason, I didn&amp;#8217;t know about this show until I walked past the venue a few days before and saw the &amp;#8220;sold out&amp;#8221; signs. But a day or so later, I got an email from the venue offering tickets. So I snapped one up and had an amazing evening. It was the first time I&amp;#8217;d seen them, but I strongly suspect it won&amp;#8217;t be the last. That&amp;#8217;s them in the photo at the top of this post.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/40320756-roxy-music-at-o2"&gt;Roxy Music at the O2 Arena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some years there are two shows that force me to the O2 Arena. And this was one of those years. I&amp;#8217;ve been a fan of Roxy Music since the 70s but I&amp;#8217;ve never seen them live. Honestly, it would have been better to have seen them in the 70s or 80s, but it was still a great show.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/40313030-beabadoobee-at-o2-academy-brixton"&gt;Beabadoobee at Brixton Academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes you go to see an artist because of one song and it just works out. This was one of those nights. In fact, it turns out I didn&amp;#8217;t actually know &amp;#8220;Coffee For Your Head&amp;#8221; very well &amp;#8211; I just knew the sample that was used in another artist&amp;#8217;s record. But this was a great night and I hope to see her again very soon.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/40493394-sugababes-at-eventim-apollo"&gt;Sugababes at Eventim Apollo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another night of fabulous nostalgia. The Eventim Apollo seems to have become my venue of choice to see re-formed girl groups from the 80s and 90s &amp;#8211; having seen Bananarama, All Saints and now The Sugababes there in recent years. They have a surprising number of hits (far more than I remembered before the show) and they put on a great show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not everything could make the top ten though. I think was the first year that I saw Stealing Sheep and they didn&amp;#8217;t make the list (their stage shows just get weirder and weirder and the Moth Club wasn&amp;#8217;t a great venue for it) and I was astonished to find myself slightly bored at the Nine Inch Nails show at Brixton Academy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few shows sit just outside of the top ten &amp;#8211; St. Vincent at the Eventim Apollo, John Grant at the Shepherd&amp;#8217;s Bush Empire and Damon Albarn at the Barbican spring to mind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, all in all, it was a good year for live music and I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to seeing more than sixteen shows this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Did you see any great shows this year? Tell us about them in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Writing a CPAN module that talks to ChatGPT</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perlhacks.com/2022/12/writing-a-cpan-module-that-talks-to-chatgpt/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGPT</a> exposes an API, but there‚Äôs no CPAN module for taking advantage of that. Let‚Äôs put that right (with help from ChatGPT)‚Ä¶</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Write a Perl CPAN module for connecting to a ChatGPT server</em></p>
<p>To create a Perl CPAN module for connecting to a ChatGPT server, you will need to have Perl and the necessary dependencies installed on your system.</p>
<p>To begin, create a new directory for your module and create a file called ‚ÄúChatGPT.pm‚Äù with the following content:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">package ChatGPT;

use strict;
use warnings;

use Net::WebSocket::Client;
use Net::WebSocket::Server;
use HTTP::Async;

sub new {
  my ($class, %params) = @_;
  my $self = {
    host =&gt; $params{host},
    port =&gt; $params{port},
  };

  bless $self, $class;

  return $self;
}

sub send_prompt {
  my ($self, $prompt) = @_;

  my $http = HTTP::Async-&gt;new;
  my $client = Net::WebSocket::Client-&gt;new(
    url =&gt; "ws://$self-&gt;{host}:$self-&gt;{port}"
  );

  $client-&gt;connect;
  $client-&gt;send_utf8($prompt);

  my $response = $client-&gt;recv;

  $client-&gt;disconnect;

  return $response;
}

1;</pre><p>To use this module in your Perl code, you can create a new ChatGPT object and call the <code>send_prompt</code> method like this:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">use ChatGPT;

my $chatgpt = ChatGPT-&gt;new(host =&gt; 'localhost', port =&gt; 8080);
my $response = $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('What is your name?');
print "Response: $response\n";</pre><p>This will send the text prompt ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù to the ChatGPT server running on localhost at port 8080, and print the response to the console.</p>
<p>Note: This is just a basic example of how you can create a Perl CPAN module for connecting to a ChatGPT server. There are many other features and considerations that you may want to add to your module, such as error handling and customization options.</p>
<p>To make your module available on CPAN, you will need to follow the guidelines for creating and distributing CPAN modules, which can be found in the Perl documentation and online resources.</p>
<p><em>Use Moose to create the class</em></p>
<p>To use Moose to create the <code>ChatGPT</code> class, you will need to have Moose installed on your system. You can install Moose by running the following command:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">cpanm Moose</pre><p>With Moose installed, you can modify the class like this:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">package ChatGPT;

use Moose;
use Net::WebSocket::Client;
use Net::WebSocket::Server;
use HTTP::Async;

has host =&gt; (
  is =&gt; 'ro',
  isa =&gt; 'Str',
  required =&gt; 1,
);

has port =&gt; (
  is =&gt; 'ro',
  isa =&gt; 'Int', required =&gt; 1,
);

sub send_prompt {
  my ($self, $prompt) = @_;

  my $http = HTTP::Async-&gt;new;
  my $client = Net::WebSocket::Client-&gt;new(
    url =&gt; "ws://$self-&gt;{host}:$self-&gt;{port}"
  );

  $client-&gt;connect; $client-&gt;send_utf8($prompt);
  my $response = $client-&gt;recv;
  $client-&gt;disconnect;

  return $response;
}

1;</pre><p>In this version of the class, the <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> attributes are defined using Moose‚Äôs <code>has</code> keyword. These attributes are required and must be specified when creating a new <code>ChatGPT</code> object. The <code>send_prompt</code> method is unchanged from the previous example.</p>
<p>To create a new <code>ChatGPT</code> object, you can use the <code>new</code> method provided by Moose like this:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">use ChatGPT;

my $chatgpt = ChatGPT-&gt;new(host =&gt; 'localhost', port =&gt; 8080);

my $response = $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('What is your name?');

print "Response: $response\n";</pre><p>This will create a new <code>ChatGPT</code> object with the specified <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> attributes, and send the text prompt ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù to the ChatGPT server running on localhost at port 8080. The response will be printed to the console.</p>
<p>Note: This is just one way to use Moose to create the <code>ChatGPT</code> class. There are many other features and customization options available in Moose that you may want to consider adding to your class, such as type constraints, default values, and methods.</p>
<p><em>Call the class WebService::ChatGPT</em></p>
<p>To rename the <code>ChatGPT</code> class to <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code>, you will need to update the package name at the top of the file and update the <code>use</code> statements to refer to the new package name.</p>
<p>Here is how you can update the <code>ChatGPT</code> class to use the new package name:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">package WebService::ChatGPT;

use Moose;
use Net::WebSocket::Client;
use Net::WebSocket::Server;

use HTTP::Async;

has host =&gt; (
  is =&gt; 'ro',
  isa =&gt; 'Str',
  required =&gt; 1,
);

has port =&gt; (
  is =&gt; 'ro',
  isa =&gt; 'Int',
  required =&gt; 1,
);

sub send_prompt {
  my ($self, $prompt) = @_;

  my $http = HTTP::Async-&gt;new;
  my $client = Net::WebSocket::Client-&gt;new(
    url =&gt; "ws://$self-&gt;{host}:$self-&gt;{port}"
  );

  $client-&gt;connect; $client-&gt;send_utf8($prompt);
  my $response = $client-&gt;recv;
  $client-&gt;disconnect;

  return $response;
}

1;</pre><p>With these changes, the class is now called <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> and can be used like this:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">use WebService::ChatGPT;

my $chatgpt = WebService::ChatGPT-&gt;new(host =&gt; 'localhost', port =&gt; 8080);

my $response = $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('What is your name?');
print "Response: $response\n";</pre><p>This will create a new <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> object with the specified <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> attributes, and send the text prompt ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù to the ChatGPT server running on localhost at port 8080. The response will be printed to the console.,/p&gt;</p>
<p>Note: This is just one way to rename the <code>ChatGPT</code> class to <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code>. You may also need to update any other references to the class name in your code and documentation, as well as update the module file name and directory structure to reflect the new package name.</p>
<p><em>Suggest some tests using the standard Perl testing framework</em></p>
<p>Here are some examples of tests that you could write for the <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> module using the standard Perl testing framework (Test::More):</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">use Test::More;
use WebService::ChatGPT;

# Test creating a new ChatGPT object
my $chatgpt = WebService::ChatGPT-&gt;new(host =&gt; 'localhost', port =&gt; 8080);
isa_ok($chatgpt, 'WebService::ChatGPT', 'Object is a ChatGPT');

# Test sending a prompt and receiving a response
my $response = $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('What is your name?');
is($response, 'My name is ChatGPT.', 'Response is correct');

# Test sending an invalid prompt
eval { $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('') };
like($@, qr/Invalid prompt/, 'Invalid prompt error is thrown');

done_testing();</pre><p>The first test uses the <code>isa_ok</code> function to check that the object created by the <code>new</code> method is an instance of the <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> class.</p>
<p>The second test uses the <code>is</code> function to compare the expected response to the actual response returned by the <code>send_prompt</code> method.</p>
<p>The third test uses the <code>eval</code> function to catch any exceptions thrown by the <code>send_prompt</code> method when an invalid prompt is provided, and the <code>like</code> function to check that the exception message matches the expected error message.</p>
<p>These tests can be run using the <code>prove</code> command:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">prove -l t/chatgpt.t</pre><p/>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate blog posts can be bad for search engine optimization (SEO) for several reasons.</p>



<p>First and foremost, AI-generated content is often low quality and lacks the depth and substance that search engines look for when ranking content. Because AI algorithms are not capable of understanding the nuances and complexities of human language, the content they produce is often generic, repetitive, and lacks originality. This can make it difficult for search engines to understand the context and relevance of the content, which can negatively impact its ranking.</p>



<p>Additionally, AI-generated content is often not well-written or structured, which can make it difficult for readers to understand and engage with. This can lead to a high bounce rate (the percentage of visitors who leave a website after only viewing one page), which can also hurt the website‚Äôs ranking.</p>



<p>Furthermore, AI-generated content is often not aligned with the website‚Äôs overall content strategy and goals. Because AI algorithms are not capable of understanding the website‚Äôs target audience, brand voice, and core messaging, the content they produce may not be relevant or useful to the website‚Äôs visitors. This can lead to a poor user experience, which can also hurt the website‚Äôs ranking.</p>



<p>Another issue with AI-generated content is that it can be seen as spammy or low quality by both search engines and readers. Because AI-generated content is often produced in large quantities and lacks originality, it can be seen as an attempt to manipulate search engine rankings or trick readers into engaging with the website. This can lead to the website being penalized by search engines or losing the trust and loyalty of its visitors.</p>



<p>In conclusion, using AI to generate blog posts can be bad for SEO for several reasons. AI-generated content is often low quality, poorly written, and not aligned with the website‚Äôs content strategy. It can also be seen as spammy or low quality by both search engines and readers, which can hurt the website‚Äôs ranking and reputation. It is important for websites to prioritize creating high-quality, original, and relevant content to improve their SEO and provide a positive user experience.</p>

    <title>Containers for Coverage</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://davorg.medium.com/containers-for-coverage-1db8dfc76c2d?source=rss-3781feb8a4f4------2" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*YjwJ59dr4XVoMb1b.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been building Docker containers again. And I think you‚Äôll find this one a little more useful than &lt;a href="https://perlhacks.com/2022/10/building-a-perlanet-container/"&gt;the Perlanet one&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about a couple of weeks¬†ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I got into &lt;a href="https://www.travis-ci.com/"&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; and set up lots of &lt;a href="https://github.com/davorg?tab=repositories"&gt;my GitHub repos&lt;/a&gt; so they automatically ran the tests each time I committed to the repo. Later on, I also worked out how to tie those test runs into &lt;a href="https://coveralls.io/"&gt;Coveralls.io&lt;/a&gt; so I got pretty graphs of how my test coverage was looking. I gave &lt;a href="https://www.slideshare.net/davorg/github-travisci-and-perl"&gt;a talk about what I had¬†done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two things¬†changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Travis CI got too popular and, eventually, removed their free service. And, secondly, &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; was introduced. Over the last few years, I‚Äôve set up many of my repos to use GitHub Actions for CI. But, basically because I‚Äôm lazy, I didn‚Äôt remove the Travis CI configuration from those¬†repos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But last week I decided the time was right to start work on that. And when I went to remove the¬†.travis.yml I realised that something was missing from my GitHub Actions CI workflows‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey were running the unit tests, but they weren‚Äôt reporting on test coverage. So it was time to fix¬†that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I needed to reimplement the logic that connected Travis CI to Coveralls.io in a GitHub workflow. That actually turned out to be pretty simple. There‚Äôs a CPAN module called &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::Cover::Report::Coveralls"&gt;Devel::Cover::Report::Coveralls&lt;/a&gt; which takes the output from Devel::Cover, converts it to the correct format and sends it to Coveralls.io. And, as a bonus, it has documentation showing how to implement that in a GitHub workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I hacked at my workflow definition file for one of my CPAN modules and within a few minutes I had it¬†working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I say ‚Äúa few minutes‚Äù, but it took over thirteen minutes to run. It turns out that Devel::Cover::Report::Coveralls is a pretty heavyweight module and needs to install a lot of other modules in order to do its¬†work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, you can probably guess where this is going. And you‚Äôd be¬†right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve created a Docker container that has Devel::Cover::Report::Coveralls already installed. And, obviously, it‚Äôs available for everyone to use from the Docker hub‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää&lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/davorg/perl-coveralls"&gt;davorg/perl-coveralls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of small adjustments to my GitHub workflow and the coverage job is now running on my new container‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand takes 29 seconds instead of 13 minutes. So that‚Äôs a¬†win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relevant section of my &lt;a href="https://github.com/davorg/calendar-simple/blob/master/.github/workflows/perltest.yml"&gt;workflow file&lt;/a&gt; is¬†here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;coverage:&lt;br&gt;    runs-on: ubuntu-latest&lt;br&gt;    container: davorg/perl-coveralls:latest&lt;br&gt;    name: Test coverage&lt;br&gt;    steps:&lt;br&gt;      - uses: actions/checkout@v3&lt;br&gt;      - name: Install modules&lt;br&gt;        run: cpanm -n --installdeps .&lt;br&gt;      - name: Coverage&lt;br&gt;        env:&lt;br&gt;          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}&lt;br&gt;        run: cover -test -report Coveralls&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it‚Äôs producing nice graphs on Coveralls.io like the one¬†above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you find it¬†useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://perlhacks.com/2022/10/containers-for-coverage/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perl¬†Hacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1db8dfc76c2d" width="1" height="1" alt=""&gt;</content>

    <title>Not that PR, thanks</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://davorg.medium.com/not-that-pr-thanks-a1b15653a75?source=rss-3781feb8a4f4------2" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/966/0*pLISkpVDhfg0_iwn.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs October. And that means that &lt;a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/"&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt; has started. If you can get four pull requests accepted on other people‚Äôs code repositories during October then you can win a¬†t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, I think it‚Äôs a great idea. It encourages people to get involved in open source software. But in other ways, it can be a bit of a pain in the arse. Some people go crazy for a free t-shirt and that means you‚Äôll almost certainly get several pull requests that aren‚Äôt really of the quality you‚Äôd hope¬†for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a particular problem that probably isn‚Äôt very common. I‚Äôve talked before about the ‚Äúsemi-static‚Äù sites I run on GitHub Pages. There‚Äôs some data in a GitHub Repo and every couple of hours the system wakes up and runs some code which generates a few HTML pages and commits those HTML pages into the repo‚Äôs ‚Äú/docs‚Äù directory. And‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähey presto!‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthere‚Äôs a new version of your web¬†site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good example is &lt;a href="https://perl.theplanetarium.org/"&gt;Planet Perl&lt;/a&gt;. The data is a YAML file which mostly consists of a list of web feeds. Every couple of hours we run &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Perlanet/view/bin/perlanet"&gt;perlanet&lt;/a&gt; to pull in those web feeds and build a new version of the web site containing the latest articles about¬†Perl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you see what the problem¬†is?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the most obvious file in the repo is the ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù which is the web site. So when people find that repo and want to make a small change to the web site they‚Äôll change that ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù file. But that file is generated. Every few hours, any changes to that file are overwritten as a new version is created. You actually want to change ‚Äúindex.tt‚Äù. But that uses &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Template-Toolkit/view/lib/Template/Manual/Directives.pod"&gt;Template Toolkit syntax&lt;/a&gt;, so it‚Äôs easy enough to see why people with no Perl knowledge might want to avoid editing¬†that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/davorg/planetperl/blob/master/README.md"&gt;README file&lt;/a&gt; for the project explains which files you might want to change in order to make different types of changes. But people don‚Äôt read that. Or, if they do read it, they ignore the bits that they don‚Äôt¬†like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I get pull requests that I have to reject because they change the wrong¬†files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year I got enough of these problematic pull requests that I decided to automate a solution. And it‚Äôs &lt;a href="https://github.com/davorg/planetperl/blob/master/.github/workflows/reject-pr.yml"&gt;this pretty simple GitHub Workflow&lt;/a&gt;. It runs whenever my repo receives a pull request and looks at the files that have been changed. If that list of files includes ‚Äúdocs/index.html‚Äù then the PR is automatically closed with a polite message explaining what they‚Äôve done¬†wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes my life easier. It‚Äôs possible it might make your life easier¬†too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://perlhacks.com/2022/10/not-that-pr-thanks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perl¬†Hacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a1b15653a75" width="1" height="1" alt=""&gt;</content>

    <title>Should Children be Polite While Using Smart Speakers?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2022/05/should-children-be-polite-while-using-smart-speakers.html" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>‚ÄòOkay Google. Where is Antarctica?‚Äù</p>
<p>Children can now get answers to all their questions using smart speakers and digital voice assistants.</p>
<p>A few years ago, children would run to their parents or grandparents to answer their questions. But with the ascendence of voice assistants to the mainstream in recent years, many children rely more on technology than humans.</p>
<p>Is this a good idea?</p>
<p>How does it impact the children?</p>
<p>When children interact with people, it helps them be more thoughtful, creative, and imaginative.</p>
<p>When they use artificial intelligence instead, several issues come into the foreground. These include access to age-inappropriate content and increasing the possibility of being rude or unpleasant, affecting how they treat others.</p>
<p>As mentioned, technology has both pros and cons. There are benefits to children using these devices, including improving diction, communication, social skills, and gaining information without bothering their parents.</p>
<p>Many families find that smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home are useful. They use them for several functions, ranging from answering questions to setting the thermostat. Research shows that up to nine out of ten children between the ages of four and eleven in the US are regularly using smart speakers ‚Äî often without parental guidance and control. So, what is the best approach for a parent to take?</p>
<p>Children up to seven years old can find it challenging to differentiate between humans and devices, and this can lead to one of the biggest dangers. If the device fulfils their requests through rude behaviour, children may behave similarly to other humans.</p>
<h2>Do Parents Think Smart Devices Should Encourage Polite Conversations?</h2>
<p>Most parents consider it essential that smart devices should encourage polite conversations as a part of nurturing good habits in children. The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood or CCFA is a US coalition of concerned parents, healthcare professionals, and educators. Recently, CCFA protested against Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition, stating that it may affect children‚Äôs wellbeing. Because of this, they requested parents avoid buying Amazon Echo.</p>
<p>However, in reality, these smart devices have improved a lot and focus on encouraging polite conversations with children. It is all about how parents use and present these devices to their children, as these factors can influence them a lot.</p>
<p>But in simple terms, parents wish these devices to encourage politeness in their children. At the same time, they want their kids to understand the difference between artificial intelligence and humans while using these technological innovations.</p>
<h2>Do Parents Think Their Children are Less Polite While Using Smart Speakers?</h2>
<p>Many parents have seen their children behave rudely to smart speakers. Several parents have expressed their concerns through social media, blog posts and forums like Mumsnet. They fear these behaviours can impact their kids when they grow up.</p>
<p>A report published in Child Wise reached the conclusion that children who behave rudely to smart devices might be aggressive while they grow up, especially while dealing with other humans. It is, therefore, preferable if children use polite words while interacting with both humans and smart devices.</p>
<h2>What Approaches Have Been Taken By Tech Companies to Address the Problem?</h2>
<p>With interventions and rising concerns addressed by parents and health professionals, some tech companies have brought changes to virtual assistants and smart speakers.</p>
<p>The parental control features available in Alexa focus on training kids to be more polite. Amazon brands it as Magic Word, where the focus is on bringing positive enforcement. However, there is no penalty if children don‚Äôt speak politely. Available on Amazon Echo, this tool has added features like setting bedtimes, switching off devices, and blocking songs with explicit lyrics.</p>
<p>When it comes to Google Home, it has brought in a new feature called Pretty Please. Here, Google will perform an action only when children use, please. For instance, ‚ÄúOkay, Google. Please set the timer for 15 minutes.‚Äù</p>
<p>You can enable this feature through the Google Family Link, where you can find the settings for Home and Assistant. You can set these new standards for devices of your preference. Also, once you use it and figure things out, there will be no more issues in setting it up again.</p>
<p>These tools and their approaches are highly beneficial for kids and parents. As of now, these devices only offer basic features and limited replies. But with time, there could be technological changes that encourage children to have much more efficient and polite interactions.</p>
<h2>George and the Smart Home</h2>
<p>It was thinking about issues like this which led me to write my first children‚Äôs book ‚Äî George and the Smart Home. In the book, George is a young boy who has problems getting the smart speakers in his house to do what he wants until he learns to be polite to them.</p>
<p>It is available now, as a paperback and a Kindle book, from Amazon.</p>
<p>Buy it from: <a href="https://amazon.com.au/dp/B09VPLGMBN">AU</a> / <a href="https://amazon.com.br/dp/B09VPLGMBN">BR</a> / <a href="https://amazon.ca/dp/B09VPLGMBN">CA</a> / <a href="https://amazon.de/dp/B09VPLGMBN">DE</a> / <a href="https://amazon.es/dp/B09VPLGMBN">ES</a> / <a href="https://amazon.fr/dp/B09VPLGMBN">FR</a> / <a href="https://amazon.in/dp/B09VPLGMBN">IN</a> / <a href="https://amazon.it/dp/B09VPLGMBN">IT</a> / <a href="https://amazon.co.jp/dp/B09VPLGMBN">JP</a> / <a href="https://amazon.com.mx/dp/B09VPLGMBN">MX</a> / <a href="https://amazon.nl/dp/B09VPLGMBN">NL</a> / <a href="https://amazon.co.uk/dp/B09VPLGMBN">UK</a> / <a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B09VPLGMBN">US</a></p>

    <title>2021 in Gigs</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2022/01/2021-in-gigs.html" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A little later than usual, here‚Äôs my review of the gigs I saw last year.</p>
<p>In 2020, I saw four gigs. In 2021, I almost doubled that to seven. Obviously, we spent a lot of the year with most music venues closed, so those few gigs I saw were all in the second half of the year. Usually, I‚Äôd list my top ten gigs. This year (as last year) I‚Äôll be listing them all. So here they are in chronological order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39755096-mike-oldfield-at-royal-festival-hall-southbank-centre">Tubular Bells at the Royal Festival Hall</a></strong><br/>
This was a strange show for several reasons. Firstly, it was advertised as commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of <em>Tubular Bells</em>. But the album was released in 1973, so it was two years early (apparently it was the fiftieth anniversary of when Mike Oldfield started writing the piece). Secondly, Mike Oldfield wasn‚Äôt performing ‚Äì but you needed to examine the publicity very carefully to work that out. And thirdly, there was a troupe of acrobats that were pointlessly leaping around the stage while the musicians played. All in all, I thought this was slightly disappointing.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/38968289-heaven-17-at-roundhouse">Heaven 17 at the Roundhouse</a></strong><br/>
Many of these shows were postponed from 2020. This was originally intended to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Human League album, <em>Travelogue</em>, but it ended but being the forty-first anniversary. But none of that mattered. This was Heaven 17 playing all of the first two Human League albums and it was absolutely wonderful. Apparently, they had invited Phil Oakey to take part, but he wasn‚Äôt interested. That‚Äôs Heaven 17 in the photo above.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39828850-lump-at-scala">LUMP at the Scala</a></strong><br/>
LUMP is Laura Marling playing with Tunng‚Äôs Mike Lindsay. I kinda assumed that their first album was going to be a one-off, but they produced a second album in 2020. This was the first gig I‚Äôd been to in a cramped venue like the Scala for a couple of years and it all got a bit too much for me. I really didn‚Äôt enjoy the atmosphere and left during the third or fourth song. I still love the album though and I hope to build up my tolerance for gig crowds over the coming months.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39773071-staves-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire">The Staves at Shepherd‚Äôs Bush Empire</a></strong><br/>
Actually, this was only two-thirds of the Staves. One of the sisters has has a baby recently and has decided to sit out tours for a couple of years. But the two remaining sisters still put on a great show.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39786793-laura-marling-at-roundhouse">Laura Marling at the Roundhouse</a></strong><br/>
Given how few gigs I saw last year, it‚Äôs surprising how repetitive they were. Here‚Äôs Laura Marling again (and the Roundhouse again!) Although she has yet to match the heights of the <em>Short Movie</em> tour, Laura Marling is always worth seeing and this show was no exception.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39662320-heaven-17-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire">Heaven 17 at the Shepherd‚Äôs Bush</a></strong><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39662320-heaven-17-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire"> Empire</a></strong><br/>
More repetition. I think the two Heaven 17 gigs were originally supposed to be several months apart, but the vagaries of the Covid scheduling changes led to them being just two months apart. This one celebrated the fortieth (actually forty-first) anniversary of Heaven 17 starting and was a glorious journey through their back catalogue. Oh, and the support was Pete Wylie, so I can finally say I‚Äôve seen all three members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucial_Three">Crucial Three</a> live.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39709208-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-at-eventim-apollo">Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark at Hammersmith Apollo</a></strong><br/>
OMD are just one of those bands that I see live whenever I can. I‚Äôve now been seeing them for over forty years (since they supported Gary Numan in 1980). They have such a massive back catalogue that they can just play hit after hit for two hours. But this show was a bit different as they started by playing all of their 1981 album, <em>Architecture and Morality</em>. They were as good as I‚Äôve ever seen them.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that was 2021. What will happen in 2022? Well, I have tickets for a dozen or shows but who knows how many of them I‚Äôll actually see? I‚Äôve already had emails postponing the Wolf Alice and Peter Hook shows I was going to see this month. I guess I‚Äôll just have to wait and see how the rest of the year pans out.</p>

    <title>The Return of RTD</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2021/09/the-return-of-rtd.html" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>Doctor Who</em> has a new showrunner. But he‚Äôs actually an old showrunner. Is that a good idea?</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-58682472">the news broke</a> yesterday, <em>Doctor Who</em> fan forums have been discussing nothing but the fact that Russell T Davies is returning as showrunner after Chris Chibnall‚Äôs regeneration special is broadcast next year. Most fans seem to be very excited by this prospect; I‚Äôm not so sure.</p>
<p>Before I start, I should point out that I‚Äôve been a big fan of Russell T Davies since long before he brought <em>Doctor Who</em> back to our screens in 2005. I‚Äôll always be grateful for the work he did to bring the show back and I believe that he‚Äôs responsible for some great moments in <em>Doctor Who</em> history.</p>
<p>But I‚Äôm not sure I want to see him back as the showrunner. Let me explain why I‚Äôm so out of step with most of the show‚Äôs fans.</p>
<p>Firstly, although I‚Äôm grateful to him for bringing the show back, he‚Äôs not my favourite showrunner. Obviously, any <em>Doctor Who</em> is better than no <em>Doctor Who</em> but there was a lot of stuff in Davies‚Äô first run that I didn‚Äôt like. For example, He was the person who first introduced us to companions‚Äô families, which brought a slight soap opera feel to some of the episodes. Also, I thought that he often wrote himself into a bit of a corner. This was most apparent in the end of season two-parters. There were many occasions when the first part set up a fantastic premise only to be let down by a finale that just couldn‚Äôt live up to the promise. <em>The Stolen Earth</em> was great; <em>Journey‚Äôs End</em> was terrible. Then there‚Äôs <em>The End of Time</em>. Again, it started off well but had verged well into the ridiculous by the end of the first part. And don‚Äôt get me started on the self-indulgent, mawkish nonsense that made up the last twenty minutes of that story ‚Äî leading to the Tenth Doctor‚Äôs regeneration.</p>
<p>I admit, however, that my opinions on Davies‚Äô writing are purely personal. And, because of the massive rise in popularity of the show during his tenure, many viewers see his approach as the gold standard for how the show should work. My other points are, I hope, less opinion-based.</p>
<p>Secondly, <em>Doctor Who</em> is a show that should always be moving forward. In the classic era of the show, previous Doctors and companions would reappear very rarely. When someone left the show, you knew the chances of seeing them again were very slim. When an executive producer left (we didn‚Äôt call them showrunners back then) you knew that the show would change in new and experimental ways. Sometimes the changes didn‚Äôt work; most of the time they did. Change is fundamental to the show. It‚Äôs how the show has kept going for (most of) sixty years.</p>
<p>The newer sections of the audience don‚Äôt seem to realise that. I constantly hear fans wanting things to go back to how things were. As soon as Rose was written out at the end of series two, there were calls for her to come back. And while series four has some pretty good stuff in it, I think that bringing Rose back was pandering to the fanbase in an unhealthy way. We now have a situation where fans expect every character who has been written out of the show to be brought back at their whim. There aren‚Äôt very many weeks that pass without me seeing someone in a Facebook group suggesting some convoluted way that David Tennant could be brought back to be the Doctor again.</p>
<p>The show must always move forward. It must always change. I believe that RTD knows that, so I hope that his second era in charge will be sufficiently different to his first. But I worry that fans will start asking for Tennant back as the Doctor with Billie Piper by his side. For some fans, that seems to be the only version of the show they will be happy with.</p>
<p>Finally, I worry about what RTD‚Äôs reappointment means for the future of the show. When Chibnall‚Äôs departure was announced, all of the news stories claimed that he and Whittaker had a ‚Äúthree and out agreement‚Äù between themselves and that he only ever planned to do three years running the show. That‚Äôs rather at odds with the talk of him having a five-year plan for the show when he was appointed to the role. I realise that he will have done five years in the post by the time he goes, but he will have made three seasons and a handful of specials ‚Äî so I‚Äôm not sure that counts.</p>
<p>No, I think it‚Äôs clear that Chibnall has been hounded out of the role by that toxic sector of the fanbase that refuses to give his work on the show a decent chance. And, given that Moffat also put up with a lot of abuse from certain fans, I begin to wonder how easy it is to find someone to take over the job. Chibnall‚Äôs departure was announced at the end of July and the BBC would certainly have known about it for some time before that. But they have failed to find someone new and exciting to take over the job and I wonder if it has become a bit of a poison chalice. People want to do the job because, hey, it‚Äôs running Doctor Who! But, on the other hand, if you don‚Äôt please the fanbase (and no-one can please all of the fanbase) then you‚Äôll be vilified online and hounded off social media. Add to that the fact that both Davies and Moffat cited insane working schedules as part of their reason for leaving and, suddenly, the job doesn‚Äôt look quite as tempting.</p>
<p>I have no inside information here at all, but I wonder if the reappointment of RTD was an act of desperation on the part of the BBC. We know that Chibnall is steering the show up to and including a BBC centenary special that will be broadcast in 2022. But the show‚Äôs 60th anniversary is the year after that and without a showrunner, you can‚Äôt cast a new Doctor and without a new Doctor in place pretty soon, the 60th-anniversary celebrations would seem to be in danger.</p>
<p>The news of the reappointment has all been very celebratory, of course, but I wonder if that‚Äôs actually the case. I wonder if the BBC‚Äôs approach to RTD was more like this:</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo, that show you resurrected back in 2005. Well, we can‚Äôt find anyone to take over as showrunner, and unless we get things moving pretty quickly we‚Äôre not going to have a 60th anniversary worth speaking off. Seriously, we‚Äôre thinking of just cancelling it‚Ä¶ unless you can suggest something that we could do‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>This, of course, leaves RTD thinking that the only way to save his baby is to step in himself. Maybe he‚Äôs stepped in as a stop-gap until the BBC finds someone else to take over. The announcement says he‚Äôs signed on for the 60th special and following series. But that‚Äôs a bit vague (because the English language doesn‚Äôt have a plural for ‚Äúseries‚Äù!) so who knows how long he‚Äôll hang around for. Time will tell, I guess.</p>
<p>But, if you‚Äôre one of those fans who think it‚Äôs big or clever to be unrelentingly negative about the showrunner on social media, please stop and consider whether you‚Äôre part of a problem that could end up with no-one wanting the job and the show being cancelled.</p>
<p>All-in-all, I wish that the BBC hadn‚Äôt done this. I would have far preferred to see the show moving forward. But if, as I suspect, the alternative was no new Doctor Who for the foreseeable future, then obviously this is a good plan. I‚Äôm keen to see what Davies has in store.</p>
<p>But first I‚Äôm really excited to see what Chibnall has in store for his final series and the subsequent specials. If series 13 improves on series 12 to the extent that series 12 improved on series 11, then it‚Äôs going to be great.</p>
